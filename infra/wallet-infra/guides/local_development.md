# Running Wallet-Infra Locally

This guide explains how to run the UTXO Management Server **locally** using **Docker Compose**. This will spin up two containers:

1. A MySQL container
2. The “utxo-management-server” container with Node.js

### Requirements

- **Docker** installed (v20+ recommended)
- **Node.js** installed if you plan to run `npm install` locally (v18+ recommended)
- **Git** for code management (optional but typical)

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/wallet-infra.git
   cd wallet-infra
   ```

2. **Install and build local dependencies** (optional but helpful if you intend to run build steps outside Docker):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**: 
   - Typically done inside the `docker-compose.yml`. 
   - By default, we have:

     ```yaml
     environment:
       NODE_ENV: "development"
       BSV_NETWORK: "test" # main | test
       HTTP_PORT: "8080"
       SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY: "${SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY:?Set SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY to a dedicated local-only key}"
       KNEX_DB_CONNECTION: '{"host":"mysql","user":"root","password":"rootPass","database":"wallet_storage","port":3306}'
     ```
   - Export a newly generated, local-only `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` before running
     Compose. Never reuse a checked-in example key or a production identity.
   - You can edit the remaining values in `docker-compose.yml` to suit your environment.

4. **Run Docker Compose**:

Make sure Docker is running on your machine, then run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   - This will:
     - **Build** the Node image from the included `Dockerfile`.
     - **Launch** the MySQL container (exposing `3306` to your machine).
     - **Launch** the Node container, automatically running migrations at startup.
     - Node server will listen on port `8080` (mapped to `localhost:8080`).

5. **Check logs**:
   - You should see something like:
     ```
     utxo-management-server  | wallet-storage server v0.4.5
     utxo-management-server  | wallet-storage server started
     ```
   - This indicates the system is ready and listening on `http://localhost:8080`.

6. **Connect a wallet client**:
   - Configure your client so that the “remote storage” is at `http://localhost:8080` (or the relevant host/port).
   - The server manages your UTXOs in MySQL.

7. **Stopping**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

That’s it for local development. Each time you change code, you can re-run `docker-compose up --build` or rely on volume mounting for hot reload (though be mindful of overwriting `node_modules`).
