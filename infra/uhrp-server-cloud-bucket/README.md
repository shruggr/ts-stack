# UHRP Storage Server – Deployment Guide

See [Service Resource Profiles](../../docs/reference/service-resource-profiles.md)
for list, retention, response, connection, and provider-scaling guidance.

The service implements the BRC-167 CHIRP baseline routes under `/chirp/v1`.
CHIRP objects, sessions, and root leases use the `chirp/v1/` bucket namespace;
the ordinary `/cdn/*` backend-bucket rule remains unchanged because CHIRP
objects are served by Cloud Run with closure authorization. A root is submitted
to `tm_uhrp` only after its entire closure validates, `/renew` extends every
object's GCS `customTime`, and bounded GC preserves deduplicated objects while
any session or advertised root still references them. Existing UHRP APIs and
bucket object layouts remain compatible. Public object membership is served
from a bounded, expiring commit index rather than reparsing the full closure on
every request. Tune it with `CHIRP_COMMIT_CACHE_ROOTS`,
`CHIRP_COMMIT_CACHE_OBJECTS`, and `CHIRP_COMMIT_CACHE_SECONDS`.
Authenticated staging is bounded by atomic host-wide, per-identity,
per-session object, and per-session byte quotas. Commits for the same root are
serialized across instances through generation-guarded bucket locks. Tune the
limits with `CHIRP_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS`,
`CHIRP_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_PER_IDENTITY`,
`CHIRP_MAX_STAGED_OBJECTS_PER_SESSION`, and
`CHIRP_MAX_STAGED_BYTES_PER_SESSION`; invalid or non-positive values fail
startup.

UHRP and CHIRP renewal keep the existing retention timestamp or advance it to the renewed expiry plus five minutes. Metadata updates use metageneration preconditions and bounded retries; a short extension never reduces Google Cloud Storage `customTime`.

Signed ownership metadata accepts the ordinary `/cdn/<object>` location and the
exact CHIRP root route `/chirp/v1/<root>/objects/<root>`. A CHIRP root identifier
must equal the advertised content hash identifier; unrelated objects, query
strings and credentials are rejected. Renewal reads the actual CHIRP root
object, extends its committed closure and rejects an inactive root. It does not
create or rely on a duplicate CDN copy.

Renewal pricing reads that same verified storage object: ordinary advertisements
use `cdn/<object>`, and CHIRP root advertisements use
`chirp/v1/objects/<root>`. Both paths retain the signed-owner and current provider
size checks; a missing root fails closed without a CDN fallback.

Authenticated staged-object HEAD responses have no body, including existence
and validation-error responses. Authentication signs the same empty bytes
that HTTP sends, allowing clients to verify both present and absent objects
before an upload. Other methods retain their existing JSON error responses.

Authenticated staged-object PUTs parse bounded identity bytes before BRC-103
verification. The handler stages those same verified bytes rather than rereading
the consumed request stream. The parser is scoped to staged-object PUTs, rejects
compressed bodies, and retains the `CHIRP_OBJECT_MAX_BODY_BYTES` ceiling
(default 4 MiB). JSON routes, HMAC streaming `/put`, and bodyless HEAD responses
retain their existing behavior. Use SDK 2.8.9 or later for full-size authenticated
CHIRP chunks; its HTTP transport keeps its existing framing and response limits.
No object, session, advertisement or persistence migration is required.

## Advertisement, ownership, and upload trust

The public UHRP token authenticates the host identity, content hash, HTTPS
location, expiry, size, and host-derived locking key. Uploader identity and the
GCS object identifier are not wire fields, so owner-only list, find, and renew
operations additionally require locally server-signed wallet metadata bound to
the exact token, BEEF output, and tags. Unsigned legacy metadata is not accepted
as ownership evidence. Owner listings omit those rows and report
`legacyAdvertisementsPending` for the current raw wallet page; `nextOffset`
lets clients continue through older rows to verified records. Signed rows still
fail closed on signature, source-output, selector, or tag disagreement.

The four ownership/lookup tags must match signed metadata. Older insertions
may lack descriptive name, size, and type tags; their size and type remain
authenticated in the envelope, and present descriptive tags must agree.

## Recover legacy ownership without replacing transactions

The 0.2.45 operator tool can add signed metadata to an existing output without
spending, rebroadcasting, or extending its hosting commitment. Run it with the
service identity and private runtime configuration, first without `--apply`:

```sh
node out/src/cli/migrateLegacyAdvertisements.js
node out/src/cli/migrateLegacyAdvertisements.js --apply
```

It verifies the token signature and host key, source output, exact configured
location, provider ownership receipt, size, retention, generation, and streamed
SHA-256 content before signing. A second metadata read detects generation
races. The wallet merges the envelope into the original output and read-back
confirms its outpoint, value, and spendable state. Lookup tags are checked
against provider ownership; they never supply ownership authority.

The scan and each stream are bounded. Summaries contain counts only. A failed
row makes the command exit nonzero and needs private operator investigation;
expired, invalid, missing, or changed objects must not be silently reissued or
given new retention. Already verified records are idempotent. Keep a private
pre-migration inventory and validate owner list/find/renew plus public lookup
and retrieval in staging before production. Earlier images cannot manage
legacy records without signed metadata; forward-fix recovery rather than
rolling back verification. Public token bytes and object contents are unchanged.

Paid upload capabilities are valid for at most 15 minutes and never beyond the
purchased retention window. Their signatures bind the exact content length,
uploader metadata, safe binary response type, attachment disposition, and a
zero-generation precondition, preventing size substitution and URL replay to
overwrite an object. Billable renewal size is checked against both signed
advertisement metadata and current GCS metadata, and pricing errors fail closed.

This guide walks you through deploying **UHRP Storage Server** on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with continuous delivery via GitHub Actions. When you finish, you’ll have:

- A single‑region **Cloud Storage bucket** that stores all UHRP data.

- A **Cloud Run** service that handles uploads, billing, and API requests.

- A **Cloud Run** service that handles the broadcasting and advertising of your UHRP data.

- An **HTTP Load Balancer** that fronts both the bucket (static files) and Cloud Run (dynamic API) behind a custom HTTPS domain.

- The protected root `infra-release.yaml` workflow that publishes immutable,
  scanned images for a separate operator-owned deployment process.

> **Security note** This imported deployment walkthrough is historical context,
> not authorization to grant project Owner or store service-account JSON keys.
> Current deployments must use a reviewed protected release workflow, GitHub
> OIDC/Google Workload Identity Federation, separate least-privilege
> deploy/runtime/notifier identities, and Secret Manager for application
> secrets. Do not place cloud credentials in repository secrets or generated
> service manifests.

## Prerequisites

**GCP Project with billing**
Create a new Project on Google Cloud Platform that you have owner or editor access and is funded

**GitHub account & repo**
You will fork/clone and push the code to your own repository.

**Domain name**
Optional but recommended for the HTTPS front‑end (e.g. `storage.example.com`).

**gcloud CLI**
Only required for the few shell commands shown below. Everything else uses the Cloud Console UI.

---

## 1 Use the TS Stack source repository

1.  **Fork or clone** the TS Stack repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack.git
    cd ts-stack/infra/uhrp-server-cloud-bucket
    ```

2.  Review the root `.github/workflows/infra-release.yaml` image-release
    workflow and the operator-owned Cloud Run deployment configuration. The
    retired package-local setup/deploy workflows are intentionally absent.

---

## 2 Configure federated deployment and managed secrets

Before provisioning, create the Google Cloud project and a Workload Identity
Federation trust restricted to the protected repository/environment. Do not
create downloadable service-account keys.

### 2.1 Create a Google Cloud Project and deployment identities

1.  **Create a new GCP project**

    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

    - In the top bar, click the **Project selector** → **New Project**.

    - Give your project a name (e.g., `uhrp-storage-server`)

    - Click **Create**.

2.  **Enable billing**

    - In the left menu, open **Billing**.

    - Link the project to an existing billing account (or create one if this is your first project).

    - Without this step, required APIs and services will not function.

3.  **Create separate keyless identities**

    - Bind the deployment identity through GitHub OIDC/Workload Identity
      Federation and restrict its principal set to the reviewed repository and
      protected deployment environment.
    - Grant only the Artifact Registry, Cloud Run deployment, and service
      account impersonation permissions used by the release workflow.
    - Give the runtime object access only to its one bucket plus
      `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` for short-lived signed upload URLs. Give
      the notifier read access only to finalized objects and permission to
      invoke the storage service.
    - Keep bootstrap administration outside CI and remove it after provisioning.

---

### 2.2 Prepare your environment file

1.  From the repo root, copy the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp secrets/.env.example secrets/staging.env   # or prod.env for production
    ```

2.  Open the new file and fill in the required values for your environment.
    Refer to the inline comments in `.env.example` and update the fields as appropriate.

> Cloud Run should use Application Default Credentials from its bound runtime
> service account. `GCP_STORAGE_CREDS`, `GCR_PUSH_KEY`, and `GCP_BOOTSTRAP_KEY`
> are legacy settings and must not be populated in Cloud Run or CI.

Invalid or unbounded rate-limit/proxy values fail startup. Forwarding headers
remain ignored unless `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` is explicitly configured. The
in-memory store is per process; replicated deployments must enforce an
aggregate policy at their trusted ingress until a shared store is configured.

---

### 2.3 Configure settings and managed secrets

Put non-secret deployment settings in the protected environment. Store
`ADMIN_TOKEN`, `SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and wallet credentials in Google Secret
Manager and mount/reference them at runtime. The legacy `sync-secrets` scripts
must not be used to upload long-lived Google credentials.

---

## 3 Provision through operator-owned infrastructure

The historical package-local `setup.yaml` workflow was retired because it used
broad static credentials. Provision these resources through reviewed,
operator-owned infrastructure as code:

1.  **Enable required APIs**
    All required GCP services (Cloud Run, Eventarc, Pub/Sub, Artifact Registry, etc.) are enabled automatically.

2.  **Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket**  
    A single-region bucket is created with **Autoclass enabled** and **soft-delete disabled**, using the name provided in your `.env` file.  
    It also applies the CORS configuration from `bucket-cors-config.json`.

3.  **Set up IAM accounts**

    - Grants Eventarc and Pub/Sub the project bindings they require.

    - Creates two service accounts:

      - **Deployer** (used by GitHub Actions to build & deploy).

      - **Runtime** (used by Cloud Run to access the bucket).

4.  **Create an Artifact Registry repository**  
    A regional Docker repository is created for your container images.

---

### 3.1 Run the reviewed provisioning workflow

Use the environment-specific operator workflow and verify its proposed IAM,
bucket, Eventarc, Artifact Registry, load-balancer, and Secret Manager changes
before applying. There is no supported package-local bootstrap action.

### 3.2 Verify keyless identities

After provisioning, verify that the deploy workflow exchanges GitHub's OIDC
token for a short-lived Google credential, the runtime uses its attached
service account through Application Default Credentials, and neither identity
has a user-managed key. Verify the runtime bucket and `signBlob` grants and the
notifier's bucket-read/invoker grants independently.

---

## 4 Understand release and deployment separation

The protected root `infra-release.yaml` workflow will build, scan, attest, sign,
and publish an immutable Linux/amd64 image. The separate operator deployment
must:

1.  Authenticate to GCP through the protected Workload Identity Federation
    provider and `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`; no JSON key is used.

2.  Select the verified image by digest rather than a mutable branch tag.

3.  Configure non-secret values and Secret Manager references without
    materializing secret values into a generated manifest.

4.  Deploy/replace the Cloud Run service in the bucket’s region.

5.  Deploy the notifier Cloud Run function on Node.js 24, matching its package
    runtime contract. The release sync includes its separate manifest and npm
    lockfile, so deploy the reviewed notifier source with the synchronized SDK
    floor. Its advertisement requests use `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`;
    sending the token only in a JSON body is unsupported. Validate the notifier
    against the staging server before promoting the same source to production.

Source pushes do not implicitly authorize a Cloud Run deployment. Promotion is
an explicit operator-owned action against a verified image digest.

---

## 5 Validate the first deployment

1. Publish and verify the image through the protected root release workflow.
2. Promote the exact digest with the operator-owned deployment system.
3. Verify Cloud Run uses the intended runtime identity, Secret Manager refs,
   internal/load-balancer ingress policy, and zero user-managed service-account
   keys.
4. Exercise health/readiness, paid size-bound upload, public retrieval,
   owner-scoped list/find, renewal, advertisement, and notifier failure paths.

| **Security policy**                    | **Default**                                                                                    |

Save to create the backend service (e.g., `uhrp-backend-service`).

#### 6.2.2 Backend **bucket** → Cloud Storage

| Field         | Value                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Bucket**    | Your previously created bucket |
| **Cloud CDN** | **Enabled** (leave defaults)   |

### 6.3 Host & path rules

Add a rule that routes CDN requests to the bucket and everything else to Cloud Run:

| Host | Path     | Backend            |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `*`  | `/cdn/*` | **Backend bucket** |

### 6.4 Create and test

Click **Create** and wait a few minutes. Then:

1.  Create an **A record** pointing your hosting domain to the load‑balancer IP (This may take a few hours).

2.  Wait for DNS propagation. The Google‑managed certificate will turn **Active** automatically.

3.  Test: Go to https://uhrp-ui.bapp.dev/ and test uploading and downloading with your hosting domain.

The service is ready for traffic only after the IAM, secret, upload-binding,
route, and failure-path checks above pass.

## 7 Next steps & hardening

- Restrict Cloud Run to accept traffic **only** from the load balancer’s identity instead of `allUsers`.

- Replace broad roles with narrower ones (e.g., Storage Object Viewer instead of Admin). Be sure to update the bucket IAM accordingly.

- Set up monitoring & alerts in **Cloud Monitoring**.

Advertisement, owner metadata and renewal operations use the same `GCP_STORAGE_CREDS`/`GCP_PROJECT_ID` identity as signed uploads. When credentials are explicitly configured, those operations must not fall back to the runtime metadata server. Unset credentials retain ADC for installations that intentionally use a runtime service account. Malformed configured credentials fail without logging their contents.

## Development watcher security maintenance

The development command uses the existing Node 24 toolchain with `tsx watch`
instead of the legacy Nodemon/ts-node-dev watcher dependency chain. It watches
`src/**` through `tsx` and polls the hidden `.env` file every 500 milliseconds
through the small `dev-watch.mjs` launcher. Environment changes request a normal
watcher restart. It preserves the telemetry preload and the service entry point,
and keeps any existing inspector configuration. Production startup, database
migrations, public routes and data formats are unchanged. Install the committed
lock with `npm ci` before using the updated development command. This removes
the unpatched `braces` path without an advisory exclusion or dependency override.
