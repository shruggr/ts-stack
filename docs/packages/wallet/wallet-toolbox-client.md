# @bsv/wallet-toolbox-client

`@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client` is the browser-safe Wallet Toolbox distribution.
It includes the BRC-100 wallet, signer, services, IndexedDB storage, and remote
storage client without Node-only Knex, SQLite, MySQL, or filesystem adapters.
The built-in BRC-177 `p nosend expiry` module works with local IndexedDB or a
2.11-compatible remote storage service; the active provider owns durable
expiry monitoring, synchronized lifecycle state, and pre-signed reclaim
submission.
IndexedDB `listOutputs` results keep `totalOutputs` equal to the full matching
count across short final and out-of-range pages.
BRC-177 anchors cover both the delivery and an economic reclaim. When the
reclaim floor is larger, the protected action pays the bounded surplus as
miner fee while retaining no wallet change. Upgrade the active storage
implementation to receive this funding fix; no wire or database migration is required.

Prepared BEEF persistence remains a server-side Knex capability. Browser
IndexedDB uses the canonical path, and compatible remote servers can enable
the optimization without a browser configuration or wire change.
Wallet snapshots are wallet-equivalent secrets and belong only in browser or
extension storage backed by an OS Keychain or comparably trusted store, never
ordinary localStorage, logs, analytics, or unprotected sync. Remote storage and
credential-bearing Arcade SSE require HTTPS except for explicit loopback
development, and transport debugging cannot expose credentials. Spending
approvals are never cached or coalesced; certificate acquisition and identity
discovery require valid certifier signatures before storage or trust scoring.
Related browser `noSend` chains retain local action batching, while unrelated
actions cannot join or commit the active workspace. Supported remote providers
can resume a soft-expired workspace using its exact persisted inputs.
`WalletStorageManager.getStores()` retains each remote provider's configured
`endpointURL` after production bundlers minify class names, so backup selection
and make-primary flows remain stable.
Immediate browser actions can chain wallet-managed change from a delayed
parent only after completed and unproven liquidity is exhausted or exact
serialized-cost comparison proves that a pathological settled plan is larger.
Pending funds are never hidden. IndexedDB wallets migrate exact untouched
144-output / 32-satoshi defaults to a progressive 5,000-satoshi preference.
Durable permission tokens retain delayed broadcast so permission approval does
not inherit network latency.
Opt-in remote-storage timing spans retain trace and parent-span correlation in
the telemetry sink without adding headers to authenticated requests.

The browser distribution also exposes the WAB UMP ambiguity fallback and
OTP-verified `startPhoneNumberChange` / `completePhoneNumberChange` flow. A
settings UI may submit the current number to force a fresh presentation hash;
it must persist the wallet snapshot immediately after success.
Browser authentication accepts one verified matching UMP token as an existing
account. When no token verifies, one clean empty overlay response establishes a
new account even if other hosts fail or return malformed records.

The browser build includes the fetch-based, credential-free ChainTracks v2
client and reconnecting SSE adapter without Node-only modules. Public defaults
cover mainnet, testnet, and TerraTestNet; STN/TSTN use an injected or configured
endpoint.

The portable local controller coalesces stale height refresh and immutable
object loads, applies failed-load backoff, and validates through the asynchronous
`InlineBulkFileDataValidator` without importing Node worker or filesystem code.

BEEF requests and schema-declared storage response bytes use the existing
negotiated compact binary JSON codec. Legacy peers retain numeric-array JSON
and identical transaction/proof bytes. Authentication and payload ceilings
remain unchanged; upgrade both clients and active storage for the savings.

IndexedDB treats empty certificate certifier/type, transaction status and
output-tag ID arrays like omitted optional filters, matching Knex. Nonempty
arrays, partial predicates and user ownership remain enforced. No API, wire
or database migration is required.

Internalizing an unproven transaction new to a user attempts broadcast before
storing recipient outputs, including a sender's no-send transaction already
known to shared storage. Rejected broadcasts return a review-actions error
and store no recipient outputs. Transactions backed by a mining proof are
not rebroadcast. Upgrade active storage; no API, wire or schema migration is required.

## Backup and recovery

Recover both key material and wallet records; a manager snapshot or device
keystore alone is not a complete data backup. IndexedDB can be evicted or lost
with the browser profile. Keep an independent data copy and test recovery on a
clean profile.
Use the [recovery guide](../../guides/wallet-backup-recovery.md),
[BRC-38/39 integration](../../guides/wallet-data-portability.md) and
[recovery drill](../../guides/wallet-recovery-drill.md). The portable helpers
require a concrete provider and a tested consistency/resource-limit strategy.

## Install

```bash
npm install @bsv/wallet-toolbox-client @bsv/sdk
```

## Use

```ts
import {
  Services,
  StorageClient,
  Wallet,
  WalletSigner,
  WalletStorageManager
} from '@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client'
```

The package publishes browser/import ESM and CommonJS conditions with matching
declarations. Its installed-consumer gate bundles the exact tarball with Vite
and esbuild, rejects Node-only modules, validates source maps, and enforces
compressed and uncompressed size budgets.

This single bundle also exports `WalletMonitorTask` (the base class for a
custom task passed to `Monitor.addTask`), `attemptToPostReqsToNetwork` with
its `PostReqsToNetworkResult` type, `parseJsonRpc` / `stringifyJsonRpc` (the
storage remoting wire format), and `verifyUnlockScripts` with its
`UnlockScriptVerificationResult` type, so a host no longer needs an
unsupported deep import to reach them:

```ts
import {
  WalletMonitorTask,
  attemptToPostReqsToNetwork,
  parseJsonRpc,
  stringifyJsonRpc,
  verifyUnlockScripts
} from '@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client'
```

Remote Wallet Storage often serves public web, extension, WUI, and mobile
clients from origins unknown at build time. The client imposes no origin
allowlist. Operators may explicitly configure one at the service edge, but
CORS is not authentication; storage authorization and identity isolation
remain mandatory in either mode.

[package README](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/tree/main/packages/wallet/wallet-toolbox/client#readme)
for complete remote and IndexedDB setup.

Open BSV License Version 6. See the

## Faucet output authorization

The source candidate adds exact completed-action binding for independently
validated local storage fees and change. The SDK capability marker is
`completeBoundAction.outputAuthorizationVersion=1`; upgrade the wallet and SDK together.
Existing SDK2 peers retain strict behavior. The separate SDK3 migration still
applies; SDK2 consumers need an additive backport or that migration. Serialized
wallet results do not carry local authority. The fee fix does not change signup
persistence or interrupted-funding reconciliation. See the package README and
[release and migration ledger](../../reference/package-api-migrations.md).
