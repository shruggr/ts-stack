# @bsv/sdk

The isolated SDK3 retirement candidate removes the obsolete serial-DID token
validation module. Native identity, certificate and authentication APIs remain.
Use the [identity/DID/VC guide](../../guides/identity-did-vc.md) and
[migration map](../../guides/identity-did-vc-migration.md). SDK3 consumer peer
qualification remains a draft prerequisite; existing SDK2 floors are preserved.

The 3.2.0 source candidate fixes saved-contact `any` searches and retains
contact-only matches in parallel public searches. Both identity-resolution
methods accept opt-in bounded contact recovery through `contactErrorMode`,
`contactTimeoutMs` and `onContactError`. Legacy defaults and contact failures
are preserved; public-discovery errors, certificate checks and wallet
permission gates remain intact. See the [SDK README](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/tree/main/packages/sdk)
for integration details. Consumers must adopt recovery explicitly and render
lookup errors separately from successful empty results. A contact deadline
does not cancel an underlying wallet request or permission prompt. This
candidate is not publication or a deployed search-component update.

The 3.2.1 source candidate aligns the Script interpreter with
[SV Node v1.2.3](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv/releases/tag/v1.2.3).
`OP_SUBSTR`, `OP_LEFT` and `OP_RIGHT` operands are decoded through the node's
checked int64 script-number path: an operand longer than nine bytes, or whose
value lies outside the signed 64-bit range, is a script number overflow instead
of being read from its first eight bytes, and `OP_SPLIT` also rejects a
position above `INT32_MAX`. Operands of eight bytes or fewer are unchanged and
no API, wire or wallet-data migration is required. This candidate is not
publication.

For `RegistryClient` and optional ProtoMap, BasketMap and CertMap descriptions,
see [registry metadata](../../guides/registry-metadata.md). It covers exact
lookups, BRC-based inclusion requests, publisher choice and the boundary between
display metadata and wallet permissions.

Published SDK 2.8.10 restores WhatsOnChain Merkle-proof verification
for block headers containing the provider's full metadata. Header objects may
contain up to 64 owned data properties, matching the existing header-list
bound. Merkle-root equality, response size limits, and rejection of accessors,
symbols, and inherited properties remain unchanged. No API, wire, proof, or
wallet-data migration is required. Protected release
[36324548797](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/actions/runs/36324548797)
verified the exact registry bytes, source provenance and CycloneDX SBOM for
source `5a4053223692b020372f5a8e20f59bf9c82cc968`.

The 2.8.8 source candidate aligns explicit script verification flags with
spending-era rules, historical signature hashing, locktime operations, and
bounded numeric allocations. The default JavaScript interpreter still lacks
the block and coin heights needed for exact node consensus validation.
There is no default local allocation cap. Callers evaluating untrusted scripts
may supply a finite `memoryLimit`; a resource limit does not prove that a script
is invalid. This candidate is not yet published.

The 2.8.6 source candidate fixes BRC-29 payment acceptance.
`Brc29RemittanceModule.acceptSettlement` now derives the recipient's own
BRC-42 child key (`forSelf: true`) when checking that the settlement output
pays the recipient. SDK 2.8.0 through 2.8.5 derived the sender-facing key, so
every valid incoming BRC-29 payment was refused with `brc29.internalize_failed`
before `internalizeAction`; no funds were internalized to a wrong key and
refused payments remain pending. `RemittanceManager` and Message Box
`PeerPayClient` acceptance recover after upgrading. No API, BRC100 wire or
wallet-data migration is required. This candidate is not yet published.

The 2.8.5 source candidate restores larger BRC-105 HTTP payment proofs and
raises request and signed-response header capacity by 4x: 32 KiB per ordinary
value, 256 KiB aggregate names and values, 512 headers, and 1 KiB per name.
The requested-certificate policy header also increases to 256 KiB, checked
before JSON parsing. Only `x-bsv-payment` request values may share the full
aggregate budget rather than the ordinary per-value limit. Resource bounds
remain finite; wire framing, body limits, deadlines and signature validation
are unchanged. The response-frame overhead allowance increases from 128 KiB
to 512 KiB to accommodate the larger header budget.
Server, proxy and fetch-runtime limits apply independently and must be verified
end to end for larger proofs. Applications affected by these client limits can
upgrade without changing BRC100 calls, public APIs, wire bytes or wallet data.
Wallets remain compatible with existing conforming applications. Publication
follows the protected SDK workflow; this candidate is not yet published.

### Transport-owned general payload policy

SDK 2.8.5 adds an optional seventh `Peer` constructor argument,
`AuthMessageValidationOptions`, also accepted as the second argument to
`snapshotAuthMessage`. `maxGeneralPayloadBytes` may be a positive safe integer
for a separate general-message payload budget, or `null` to delegate payload
capacity to the transport. Omission preserves the prior aggregate message
budget. The setting is local configuration and is never taken from a peer's
message; `Peer` snapshots it when constructed.

```ts
const peer = new Peer(wallet, transport, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, {
  maxGeneralPayloadBytes: null
})
```

Delegation excludes only the top-level general-message byte payload from the
SDK message-size accounting. Metadata budgets, dense byte validation, owned
snapshots, signatures, session identity, nonce/replay handling, and handshake
and certificate-message validation remain. Configure HTTP server and edge
capacity before delegating. The HTTP SDK client's own request/response bounds
still apply independently.

Authentication middleware 2.2.8 requires SDK 2.8.5 and selects this transport
policy itself, so its received payment headers do not hit a hidden SDK envelope
budget. Custom `ExpressTransport`/`Peer` integrations should select the same
policy when the HTTP layer owns payload admission.

Published version 2.8.4 also restores `listActions` responses containing empty
stored descriptions or unassigned basket names, including ordinary generated
change. The original strings are preserved; wallets need not fabricate display
metadata or rewrite history. Nonempty description limits, UTF-8 byte ceilings,
required scripts and labels, signed net values, nonnegative outputs and all
new-action request validation remain unchanged. Direct, HTTP JSON and binary
clients share the same regression coverage and a portable conformance vector.
No API, wire or account-data migration is required; only clients already bundling
the affected hardened SDK need a dependency update for this defect.

The 2.8.3 candidate repairs HTTP wallet discovery with an explicit BRC100
originator and binds the default JSON transport fetch receiver for browsers.
It restores signed `listActions` net amounts with the historical wire encoding,
matching JSON validation; count, length and individual output bounds stay intact.
Apps affected by these client defects can update the SDK without changing calls.
Wallets retain the existing BRC100 contract; an ecosystem-wide application
migration is not required. The candidate is not published until the protected
release workflow completes.

The action-history compatibility regression affects signed `listActions` values
in the 2.8.x binary processor and client. Updating a wallet repairs responses for
older compatible clients; an application already bundling the affected 2.8.x
binary client also needs the SDK patch. No call or persisted-data change is
needed. Synthetic cross-version checks cover SDK 2.4.0, 2.5.0, 2.7.1, 2.8.1 and
2.8.2 at eight signed/unsigned boundaries: all 40 candidate cases pass, all 32
previously valid cases retain exact response bytes, and the eight known negative
2.8.1/2.8.2 failures are recorded separately. These checks are bounded fixture
evidence, not a claim that every ecosystem application has been tested.

Version 2.8.1 repairs portable decryption of authenticated empty
AES-GCM plaintext. Browser/mobile and native Node envelopes now interoperate
for empty encrypted fields. Encryption bytes and the full authentication tag
remain unchanged. No ciphertext, account-data or API migration is required.
The patch is published through the protected [SDK release](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/actions/runs/35888747366) from commit `e09515508bf5bf22d7b56085170debc2b0803b2a`, with matching npm integrity and verified provenance.

Version 2.8.0 corrects BUMP offset arithmetic above 32 bits
through `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, preserving existing wire encodings. Root
calculation, extraction, combination and trimming use the same exact numeric
domain; malformed non-integer and unsafe offsets fail explicitly. No consumer
migration is needed for this correction.

It also adds `TOTP.generateSecure()` and `TOTP.validateSecure()` for new
authentication flows. These methods default to conventional six-character,
zero-padded codes. The existing `TOTP.generate()` and `TOTP.validate()` methods
retain their published two-digit, unpadded default so existing wire protocols
do not change; applications should preserve secure codes as strings and apply
an independent attempt limit.

The foundational cryptographic and transaction library for the BSV blockchain. Zero external dependencies — all cryptographic primitives have been validated by a third-party auditor. Every other library in the ts-stack builds on top of `@bsv/sdk`. <!-- audio: ts-stack.m4a @ 27:00 -->

Provides low-level primitives (keys, signatures, hashing), script construction and execution, transaction creation and signing, and integration interfaces for wallets and overlay networks.

Security-sensitive consumers require affirmative cryptographic verdicts.
`IdentityClient` will not publish a certificate whose certifier signature is
invalid, and `GlobalKVStore` discards untrusted overlay entries unless their
controller signature verifies as valid.

Authenticated general messages, certificate requests, and certificate
responses are bound to the identity in the nonce-selected peer session.
Transport identity metadata must match that session, and callbacks receive
only the identity used for signature verification.

Completed `createAction` and `signAction` transaction results must evidence
the value of every direct input. A completed `createAction` may rely on the
caller's immutable `inputBEEF`; otherwise the returned BEEF must include each
direct source transaction. Deferred `signableTransaction` results may remain
partial for compatibility, but the final result must be complete. Duplicate
input outpoints and zero-input transactions that create value fail validation.

## AuthFetch payment ancestry

Recipients can include the optional `x-bsv-payment-known-txids` response
header in a BRC-105 402 challenge to list transactions they already possess
and have validated. `AuthFetch` forwards up to 256 unique lowercase IDs
through the wallet's `createAction` options, including newly created payments
after repricing. Compatible wallets can then omit those ancestors from payment
BEEF. Values are comma-separated 64-character hexadecimal transaction IDs;
whitespace, duplicates, and malformed entries are ignored. An absent or
invalid-only header preserves existing payment behavior, so existing consumers
require no migration. Browser services must expose the optional response header
through their existing CORS policy to enable this optimization.
The header is an optional SDK extension, not a standardized BRC-105 header.

Authenticated HTTP response bodies use a bounded streaming buffer before
signed-message decoding: 16 MiB for application responses and 1 MiB for auth
handshakes by default. `SimplifiedFetchTransportOptions` exposes
`maxResponseBytes` and `maxHandshakeResponseBytes` for explicit deployment
limits. Malformed response frames with excessive headers or lengths,
truncation, or trailing bytes are rejected.

## Common patterns

### Build a P2PKH transaction

```typescript
import { PrivateKey, P2PKH, Transaction } from '@bsv/sdk'

const privKey = PrivateKey.fromWif('L5EY1SbTvvPNSdCYQe1EJHfXCBBT4PmnF6CDbzCm9iifZptUvDGB')
const sourceTransaction = Transaction.fromHex('0200000001...')
const recipientAddress = '1EvmsbpAY7nESLkN4ajLTMbvsaQ1HpJPGX'

const tx = new Transaction(
  1,
  [
    {
      sourceTransaction,
      sourceOutputIndex: 0,
      unlockingScriptTemplate: new P2PKH().unlock(privKey)
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      lockingScript: new P2PKH().lock(recipientAddress),
      satoshis: 5000
    },
    {
      lockingScript: new P2PKH().lock(privKey.toAddress()),
      change: true
    }
  ]
)

await tx.fee()
await tx.sign()
```

### Connect to a BRC-100 wallet

```typescript
import { P2PKH, WalletClient } from '@bsv/sdk'

const wallet = new WalletClient('auto', 'example.com')
const recipientAddress = '1EvmsbpAY7nESLkN4ajLTMbvsaQ1HpJPGX'
const lockingScript = new P2PKH().lock(recipientAddress).toHex()

const { publicKey } = await wallet.getPublicKey({
  identityKey: true
})

const action = await wallet.createAction({
  description: 'Create payment',
  outputs: [
    {
      lockingScript,
      satoshis: 1000,
      outputDescription: 'Payment output'
    }
  ]
})

console.log(publicKey, action.txid)
```

`WalletClient` implements the BRC-100 method surface. It discovers a wallet substrate such as BSV Desktop over localhost or BSV Browser over a postMessage bridge.

`CreateActionResult` can carry AtomicBEEF as either a historical `number[]` or
a binary Wallet Wire `Uint8Array`. BRC-29 remittance accepts both and emits a
portable `number[]` settlement artifact for JSON-safe transport.

For advanced postMessage integrations, `XDM` defaults to the wildcard target
origin so public apps, mobile webviews, and opaque origins can reach an embedded
wallet. Every response must still come from the current parent window and match
the invocation's random request ID. When the wallet parent has a stable known
origin, pass that exact origin to `new XDM('https://wallet.example')` to require
it on both outbound and inbound messages. This transport choice is independent
of CORS and of any CSP applied to an app's documents.

### Verify SPV with merkle proof

```typescript
import { Transaction, WhatsOnChain } from '@bsv/sdk'

const beefHex = [
  '0100beef01fe636d0c0007021400fe507c0c7aa754cef1f7889d5fd395cf1f785dd7de98eed895dbedfe4e5b',

const tx = Transaction.fromHexBEEF(beefHex)
const chainTracker = new WhatsOnChain()

if (await tx.verify(chainTracker)) {
  console.log('This transaction is on chain, proven with SPV.')
}
```

### Encode data on-chain with PushDrop

```typescript
import { PushDrop, Utils, WalletClient } from '@bsv/sdk'

const wallet = new WalletClient('auto', 'example.com')
const pushDrop = new PushDrop(wallet)

const lockingScript = await pushDrop.lock(
  [
    Utils.toArray('myAssetId', 'utf8'),
    Utils.toArray('100', 'utf8'),
    Utils.toArray(JSON.stringify({ name: 'MyToken' }), 'utf8')
  ],
  [2, 'my app token'],
  'asset-1',
  'self',
  true,
  false
)

const output = { lockingScript: lockingScript.toHex(), satoshis: 1 }
```

## Key concepts

- **Private Key** — 256-bit value from which all wallet operations derive. Never exposed in network traffic.
- **Public Key** — Elliptic curve point derived from private key; used for address generation and signature verification.
- **Script** — Combination of operation codes and data that define spending conditions. Locking scripts constrain outputs; unlocking scripts unlock them.
- **Transaction** — Atomic unit of blockchain state change. Inputs reference previous outputs (UTXOs); outputs create new UTXOs.
- **UTXO** — Unspent Transaction Output; identified by (txid, outputIndex). Spending requires a valid unlocking script.
- **Signature** — ECDSA signature with sighash byte indicating which transaction fields are committed to.
- **Merkle Proof** — Proof of inclusion in a block; enables SPV without downloading full blocks.
- **BEEF** — BRC-62 envelope; atomic bundle of transactions with merkle proofs for offline verification.
- **Wallet Interface (BRC-100)** — Standardized interface for wallet RPC between apps and wallet services. Abstracts away key management.
- **Overlay** — Second-layer protocol using on-chain anchors (PushDrop) to build services without blockchain modifications.

## When to use this

- You're building any BSV application that needs to create, sign, or verify transactions
- You need to work with Bitcoin Script or transaction primitives
- You're implementing key management or cryptographic operations
- You want to build SPV-based light clients
- You need to integrate with overlay protocols using PushDrop

## When NOT to use this

- Use [@bsv/wallet-toolbox](../wallet/wallet-toolbox.md) instead if you need full wallet functionality with persistent storage and signing management
- Use [@bsv/btms](../wallet/btms.md) if you're building token issuance/transfer (it abstracts the Script encoding)
- Use [@bsv/wallet-relay](../wallet/wallet-relay.md) if you need mobile-to-desktop wallet pairing

## Spec conformance

- **BRC-18** — Signed messages
- **BRC-29** — Bitcoin Envelope (UTXO-addressed messages)
- **BRC-42, BRC-43** — Key derivation protocols
- **BRC-62** — BEEF (transaction envelope format)
- **BRC-100** — Wallet interface standard
- **SPV** — Full merkle proof verification support
- **Bitcoin Script** — Full consensus-rule-compliant interpreter

## Common pitfalls

> **Sighash commit mismatch** — Unlocking script hash commits only to parts of the transaction. If you modify tx after signing, signature becomes invalid. Always sign last.

> **Fee estimation timing** — `tx.fee()` may vary if mempool conditions change. Estimate early and buffer for volatility, or use live fee trackers.

> **UTXO reuse across parallel transactions** — If two transactions reference the same UTXO, only one will confirm. Wallet implementations must track pending outputs.

> **AuthFetch payment authority** — Automatic BRC-105 payment creation delegates
> spending authorization to the configured wallet's `createAction` policy. Use
> a wallet that requires the intended user or policy approval. Diagnostics omit
> URL credentials/path/query, sensitive header values, transaction bytes, and
> derivation material.

> **Script evaluation order** — Unlocking script is evaluated first, then locking script. Stack must be left with true atop for success.

> **Broadcast endpoint differences** — ARC, WhatsOnChain, Teranode have different response formats and rate limits. Implement retry logic and fallback chains.

## Certificate policy and observer callbacks

SDK 2.7 records the locally requested certificate policy for each BRC-103
session. Standalone responses must fit one complete locally recorded dynamic
request allowlist or the session's handshake allowlist. Policies are copied
before sending, so a later edit of the caller's object does not change
validation. Responses never select their own validation policy. A different
dynamic request cannot satisfy an unmet handshake requirement.

The legacy v0.1 `RequestedCertificateSet` has no all-of, any-of, threshold, or
optional-field expression. Compatibility validation therefore proves only that
each supplied certificate and each non-empty disclosed-field subset is allowed
by one locally recorded set. It does **not** prove that every listed certificate
type or every requested field was supplied. Each party chooses what to request,
what to provide, and how much to disclose. Before granting access, inspect the
actual certificate types, certifiers, and decrypted fields and enforce the
application's complete authorization policy. Terminate or constrain the
session or operation when the disclosures are insufficient; protocol-level
authentication never declares the claims sufficient for the application.

The v0.1 AuthMessage fields, signatures and encodings are unchanged. Because a
certificateResponse does not echo the request nonce, concurrent responses are
matched against complete local requested sets, not individual request IDs. A
successful dynamic response consumes one matching request; failed validation
keeps it available for retry. Request the intended set explicitly instead of
relying on unrequested certificates.

An `initialRequest` is unsigned, and the v0.1 `initialResponse` signature binds
the nonce pair and identity but not its `requestedCertificates` or
`certificates` members. Built-in wallet proving encrypts revealed field keys to
the requested identity, but a certificate-request callback can observe only a
claimed identity during the initial exchange. Do not disclose plaintext or
authorize side effects from that callback. Because the requested set is
mutable, make every decision from the certificates and fields actually
disclosed and validated, never from the request alone. Prefer wallet-backed
proof creation, and use a signed post-authentication certificate request or an
application-layer integrity check when request integrity itself matters.

`listenForCertificatesReceived` is an observer. The SDK commits certificate
validation and releases its waiters before invoking listeners. A throwing or
rejecting listener stops later listeners and rejects message handling, but does
not roll back validation. The callback's third argument is the local session
nonce and its optional fourth argument is the peer nonce, allowing adapters to
bind application approval to the exact validated exchange; existing two-argument
callbacks remain compatible. Apply the requested certificate policy and
explicit application authorization before performing protected work.

Custom `AsyncSessionManager` implementations must retain the complete
`PeerSession`, including the optional local `certificatePolicy` and
`pendingCertificateRequests` fields. They are never serialized into AuthMessage.
Peer serializes its own certificate read-modify-write operations; shared stores
must also coordinate writers across instances. Older stored sessions without
these fields use the configured handshake policy.

The in-process session store evicts only unauthenticated sessions at capacity.
If every slot is authenticated, new handshakes fail until a session expires or
is removed. Only a successful locally initiated handshake can select the
implicit destination for a later `Peer` call; inbound messages cannot retarget
it.

### Wallet discovery deadlines since 2.8.2

Automatic React Native and XDM probes retain their short discovery deadlines
and remove listeners when unavailable. A successful probe creates a separate
operational connection so authentication, permission approval and valid slow
responses do not inherit the one-second/200-millisecond discovery deadline.
Explicitly configured substrate `responseTimeout` values remain enforced, and
response validation and origin checks are unchanged. No API or wire migration
is needed. Applications affected by the timeout defect can update their bundled
SDK; a wallet release alone cannot replace code served by a web application.

## Faucet output authorization

The source candidate adds exact completed-action binding for independently
validated local storage fees and change. The SDK capability marker is
`completeBoundAction.outputAuthorizationVersion=1`; upgrade the wallet and SDK together.
Existing SDK2 peers retain strict behavior. The separate SDK3 migration still
applies; SDK2 consumers need an additive backport or that migration. Serialized
wallet results do not carry local authority. The fee fix does not change signup
persistence or interrupted-funding reconciliation. See the package README and
[release and migration ledger](../../reference/package-api-migrations.md).
