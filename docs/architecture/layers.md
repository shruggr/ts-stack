# Stack Layers

The stack is organized in three primary layers with supporting components that connect horizontally.

![ts-stack layers diagram showing application APIs above the BRC-100 wallet boundary, wallet builder toolkit components below it, and @bsv/sdk as the foundation](../assets/diagrams/stack-layers.svg)

## Adjacent Capabilities

These packages are not a fourth vertical layer. They sit alongside the main stack and usually connect through the BRC-100 wallet interface, `@bsv/sdk` primitives, or direct service APIs.

| Capability                 | Packages                                                | What it provides                                                                             | Connects through                                                               |

## Foundation: @bsv/sdk

`@bsv/sdk` is the only zero-dependency package in the stack. It provides every primitive the other layers build on:

- **Cryptography** — secp256k1 and secp256r1 ECDSA, Schnorr, ECDH; SHA-256/512, RIPEMD-160, HMAC
- **Script engine** — Full Bitcoin Script interpreter and template system
- **Transactions** — Transaction builder, serialization, fee model, UTXO handling
- **BEEF** — `Beef` class: BRC-62 encoding/decoding, streaming validation ordering
- **Merkle paths** — `MerklePath` class: BRC-74 BUMP format, compound path support
- **Key derivation** — BRC-42 BKDS, BRC-43 security levels
- **Network** — `ArcBroadcaster` for transaction submission; `ChaintracksClient` for block headers
- **BRC-100 types** — Interface definitions consumed by wallet-toolbox and wallet clients

No dependencies means no `node_modules` vulnerabilities in the cryptographic core.

## BRC-100 Boundary

The BRC-100 wallet interface is the single most important seam in the stack. It separates:

- **Above** — Application business logic. Uses `createAction`, `signAction`, `listOutputs`, `listActions`, `internalizeAction`, and cryptographic primitives. Does not manage keys or storage.
- **Below** — Wallet/key management. Implements storage, signing, key derivation, UTXO selection, Merkle proof acquisition. Does not know what the application is building.

Any BRC-100-compliant wallet can be swapped below this boundary without changing application code.

## Wallet Builder Toolkit: @bsv/wallet-toolbox

`@bsv/wallet-toolbox` is not a single monolithic wallet. It is a set of composable modules:

| Module                   | Role                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `WalletStorageManager`   | Orchestrates persistence providers (active + backup + incremental sync)                    |
| `KnexWalletStorage`      | SQL persistence (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)                                                |
| `IndexedDBWalletStorage` | Browser persistence                                                                        |
| `RemoteWalletStorage`    | Remote storage over HTTPS (for relay setups)                                               |
| `Monitor`                | Background daemon: confirms transactions, acquires Merkle proofs, rebroadcasts stalled txs |
| `PrivilegedKeyManager`   | Handles the privileged-mode keyring for identity operations                                |
| `ShamirWalletManager`    | Shamir secret sharing for key backup                                                       |
| `WalletSigner`           | Bridges BRC-100 `signAction` to `@bsv/sdk` signing internals                               |
| `Services`               | Container wiring ARC, Chaintracks, WhatsOnChain                                            |

Wallet builders compose these into a BRC-100 `Wallet`. The resulting object is the same interface that `@bsv/simple` and other app-layer packages use.

## Application Layer: @bsv/simple

`@bsv/simple` is the recommended entry point for most application developers. `@bsv/simple/browser` returns a high-level browser wallet that wraps the SDK `WalletClient`; advanced callers can access the raw BRC-100 client with `wallet.getClient()`. Within a browser app, that client discovers an available wallet over localhost, postMessage, JSON API, or another supported substrate and exposes methods such as `createAction` and `listOutputs` without the app ever holding private keys. <!-- audio: ts-stack.m4a @ 00:00 -->

`@bsv/wallet-toolbox` is for developers building wallets, not applications. If you have a strong opinion about wallet UX or are building a competing wallet implementation, `wallet-toolbox` is where you start. <!-- audio: ts-stack.m4a @ 00:00 -->

Two entry points in `@bsv/simple`:

**`@bsv/simple/browser`** — Browser entry point. Communicates with the user's BRC-100 wallet over localhost, postMessage, or another SDK wallet substrate. The app never holds private keys. Exports include `createWallet`, `Wallet`, `Overlay`, `Certifier`, `DID`, `CredentialSchema`, `CredentialIssuer`, and `MemoryRevocationStore`.

**`@bsv/simple/server`** — Manages a self-custodial server wallet from a private key, using a wallet storage endpoint such as Wallet Infra. Suitable for automated agents, backend services, and MCP servers. Exports include `ServerWallet`, `ServerWalletManager`, `FileRevocationStore`, handler factories, `JsonFileStore`, `IdentityRegistry`, and `DIDResolverService`.

## Direct service access

Application code can also communicate with overlays, message box servers, and UHRP storage servers **independently of the wallet**. The wallet is only required for operations that need private keys. Private keys stay on the user's device at all times; the wallet interface is the architectural boundary separating key material from application code. <!-- audio: ts-stack.m4a @ 34:30 -->
