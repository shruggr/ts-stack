# Container Supply Chain

The infrastructure images are deployable artifacts, so their build inputs,
review gates, provenance, and rollback identity are part of the public release
contract. The controls here do not create another service. They make the
existing seven images auditable and ensure the artifact reviewed by CI is the
artifact that reaches a registry.

## Sources of truth

`governance/container-images.json` is the complete release inventory. It owns:

- the seven Docker build contexts and their `linux/amd64` platform;
- the exact digest-pinned Node base and its human-readable expected version;
- OCI title, description, uniform `LicenseRef-Open-BSV-License-6`, and
  documentation metadata; and
- the GHCR or GHCR-plus-Marketplace release route for each component.

`scripts/container-supply-chain.test.mjs`, run by `pnpm health:check`, rejects
unregistered Dockerfiles, mutable bases, `apk upgrade`, uncommitted lockfile
resolution, incomplete OCI metadata, unpinned deployment examples, and loss of
the scan, attestation, signature, Docker Dependabot, or Scorecard controls.

`governance/Dockerfile.container-bases` is dependency-discovery metadata, not a
build context. Its readable tags let Dependabot discover Node releases while
its digests let Scorecard verify pinning. Repository health requires those
tag-and-digest references, the registry's expected version and digest, and every
digest-only release `FROM` instruction to reconcile in one change. Runtime
Dockerfiles deliberately omit the tag because Docker uses the digest as the
actual identity. Automatic Sonar analysis excludes only the non-build metadata
file because its rule rejects tag-and-digest syntax; the executable zero-install
repository check remains authoritative for it.

Package locks under `infra/**/package-lock.json` are committed release inputs.
Release workflows never rewrite them. A stale or inconsistent lock therefore
fails `npm ci` before publication instead of silently producing a different
dependency graph.

## Pull request gates

The infrastructure CI matrix builds all registered images on GitHub's
Linux/amd64 runners and scans each resulting image with Trivy. Any high or
critical OS or library vulnerability, including one without an upstream fix,
blocks the merge. A finding must be fixed or entered in the repository's
time-bounded exception registry with an owner, evidence, review date, and
objective removal condition.

All base-image and deployment references use a readable version tag plus a
content digest. Dependabot proposes reviewed Docker refreshes alongside the
monthly stack-maintenance change. OpenSSF Scorecard runs on `main`, weekly, and
when repository rules change; its SARIF is retained for 90 days and uploaded to
GitHub code scanning.

## GHCR release

`.github/workflows/infra-release.yaml` accepts an `infra/v*` tag reachable from
`main`, or a manual dispatch from `main`. For every version not already present
in GHCR it:

1. resolves the component from the checked-in registry;
2. builds the image once with commit-derived metadata;
3. rejects high and critical vulnerabilities;
4. creates and retains an SPDX JSON SBOM;
5. pushes that exact reviewed image under both version and source-commit tags;
6. publishes GitHub-signed SLSA provenance and SBOM attestations to GitHub and
   GHCR;
7. keylessly signs the digest and attaches the reviewed SPDX SBOM with Cosign;
8. verifies the digest, signature, provenance, and both SBOM attestations before
   declaring the release successful.

Concurrent releases are serialized and never cancelled midway. Existing
version tags are treated as immutable and skipped rather than overwritten.

For a released digest, verify the evidence from an authenticated environment:

```sh
image_ref='ghcr.io/bsv-blockchain/overlay-server@sha256:<digest>'

docker buildx imagetools inspect "$image_ref"
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp \
  '^https://github\.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/\.github/workflows/infra-release\.yaml@refs/(tags/infra/v.+|heads/main)$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  "$image_ref"
gh attestation verify "oci://$image_ref" \
  --repo bsv-blockchain/ts-stack \
  --signer-workflow bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/.github/workflows/infra-release.yaml
gh attestation verify "oci://$image_ref" \
  --repo bsv-blockchain/ts-stack \
  --signer-workflow bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/.github/workflows/infra-release.yaml \
  --predicate-type 'https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3'
```

## AWS Marketplace

WAB's Marketplace workflow applies the same trusted-source, single-build,
Trivy, SPDX, digest, and attestation gates before registering a new immutable
Marketplace version. GitHub stores keyless SLSA and SPDX attestations against
the exact Marketplace ECR digest. It does not assume that the
Marketplace-controlled repository permits auxiliary Cosign OCI manifests.
The workflow verifies both attestations while still authenticated to ECR, then
submits the catalog change and waits for a terminal success state.

## Refresh and rollback

For a base-image refresh:

1. start from the Dependabot change in
   `governance/Dockerfile.container-bases`;
2. verify that version's multi-platform digest directly against each registry;
3. update `governance/container-images.json` and every matching digest-only
   `FROM` line in one PR;
4. let the complete image matrix build and scan;
5. merge only when repository health and security analysis pass.

Roll back a deployment by selecting a previously verified image digest, not by
moving or reusing a release tag. Retain the failing digest and workflow URL in
the incident or tracking issue so the transition remains auditable. Never
delete or overwrite a published version merely to make a rollback appear
current.

The normal path is GitHub CI on Linux/amd64. Maintainers on macOS should not
build or publish cluster images locally. An emergency manual image requires a
traceable tag, source commit, immediate upstream reconciliation, and recorded
operational evidence.
