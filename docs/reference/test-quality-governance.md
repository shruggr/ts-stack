# Test Quality and Skip Governance

The required pull-request suite must be deterministic, assertion-bearing, and
honest about what ran. CI rejects:

- a new `test.skip`, `it.skip`, `describe.skip`, `test.todo`, or legacy `xit`
  declaration that is not registered;
- a stale registration after its skip is removed;
- an empty required test body;
- an unclassified `*.man.test.ts` or `*.live.test.ts` file;
- a conformance skip without a reason, owner, review date, exact file count, and
  removal condition; and
- a conformance dispatcher that reaches `not implemented` after the test has
  started. Gaps must be declared in vector metadata instead of passing
  vacuously.

Run the contract locally:

```sh
pnpm test:governance
```

The machine-readable policy is
`governance/test-quality/policy.json`. It classifies the current suites as:

- **required** — deterministic PR and coverage tests;
- **manual/operator** (`*.man.test.ts`) — one explicitly selected suite that
  may require credentials, a funded identity, a database, cleanup, or human
  inspection;
- **scheduled live** (`*.live.test.ts`) — public-network checks that require no
  private credential but can fail because an external service is unavailable;
- **resource intensive** — deterministic checks that exceed the normal PR
  memory or time budget; and
- **conformance intended gaps** — stable vector IDs with per-file ownership and
  an explicit path to required or permanently unsupported status.

Never batch-run the Wallet Toolbox operator suites. Inspect and execute one
exact path:

```sh
pnpm --filter @bsv/wallet-toolbox test:manual -- \
  src/services/__tests/ARC.man.test.ts
```

Public live examples:

```sh
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay-express test:live
pnpm --filter @bsv/wallet-toolbox test:live -- \
  src/services/chaintracker/chaintracks/__tests/GoChaintracksServiceClient.live.test.ts
```

The SDK resource boundary is similarly explicit:

```sh
pnpm --filter @bsv/sdk test:resource
```

## Property-based security tests

Required CI uses `fast-check` to generate and shrink unexpected inputs across
25 packages and the stack's highest-risk trust boundaries:

- binary and text codecs: SDK Base58Check, DID base64url/multibase/SD-JWT,
  Bitcoin script numbers, asset outpoints, wallet action packs, and native BDK
  batches, plus wallet script classification and arbitrary OP_RETURN fields;
- public protocol parsers: Paymail addresses, Teranode message envelopes,
  reorg SSE frames, GASP requests/responses and UTXO reconciliation, overlay
  advertisements, Message Box hosts, and wallet pairing URIs;
- authorization and integrity: signed authentication bodies, exact issuer
  allowlists, BASM/TAC hashes, valid relay keys, expiry/freshness windows, and
  reserved-network rejection, plus per-origin BTMS authorization isolation and
  unsigned Bitcoin varint handling;
- HTTP and operator inputs: BRC-121 challenges, authenticated Express byte
  framing, payment replay admission, fund-wallet CLI keys/endpoints/amounts,
  currency conversion/formatting, and project-scaffolder path/configuration
  validation; and
- untrusted application data: Mandala linkage payloads, BTMS metadata and
  derivation instructions, canonical token amounts and asset IDs, and
  forge-resistant overlay log fields.

These are not round-trip-only tests. Depending on the boundary, the registered
invariants also require an independently encoded oracle, canonicalization,
length and numeric bounds, malformed-input totality, tamper rejection,
authority preservation, exact membership, or deterministic hashing. Generated
collections and byte strings are bounded so every pull request gets useful
coverage without turning CI duration into an unbounded input.

Every property suite and package declaration is registered under
`propertyTesting` in the policy. The governance check rejects a removed suite,
an unregistered `*.property.test.ts`, a missing package command, an undeclared
library/version, a missing trust-boundary/invariant description, or a run budget
below 300 generated cases. It also inventories all 33 package manifests: each
must either own a registered property suite or have a dated, owned exclusion
that explains why the package is only an adapter, composition layer, example,
or platform harness. This prevents both silent coverage gaps and low-value
properties added solely to increase a package count.

Each property is part of its package's ordinary required suite, so pull
requests execute at least 300 cases per property. The independent
`Property fuzzing` workflow runs the same complete registry every Saturday with
5,000 cases per property and a changing explicit seed. It can also be
dispatched manually with a case count, seed, and shrink path. A failing run
preserves its log for 30 days and writes an exact replay command to the workflow
summary.

Run the complete campaign locally (this builds the workspace once first):

```sh
pnpm test:property
```

Run one package while iterating:

```sh
pnpm --filter @bsv/teranode-listener test:property
```

Replay a reported counterexample exactly:

```sh
FAST_CHECK_NUM_RUNS=5000 \
FAST_CHECK_SEED=12345 \
FAST_CHECK_PATH='2:1:0' \
pnpm test:property
```

Fast-check prints the actual seed and shrink path on failure. Do not replace a
shrunk counterexample with a broad skip: first commit it as a deterministic
regression, then fix the implementation, and retain the general property.
Changes that introduce a new parser, codec, serializer, cryptographic framing
rule, network destination, or authorization decision must extend this registry
when an arbitrary-input invariant can be stated.

## Mutation-validated fuzzing

Property generation is only valuable when its assertions can detect a broken
invariant. Every one of the 25 registered property suites therefore has a
matching Stryker mutation target. The target mutates the implementation owned
by that property boundary and runs the smallest relevant combination of
property and deterministic regression tests. This catches weak round trips,
uncorrelated generators, assertions that only prove “did not throw,” and rare
boundaries that random generation is unlikely to reach.

The machine-readable ratchet is
`governance/mutation-testing/policy.json`. For each target it records the same
package, risk, trust boundary, and property suite as the property policy, plus
its measured minimum mutation score. All targets reject:

- any `NoCoverage` mutant in the selected implementation boundary;
- any compile-error or runtime-error mutant, which does not prove test
  detection; and
- a mutation-score regression below the target's reviewed baseline.

Surviving mutants are not automatically ignored. Review them to decide whether
they reveal a missing negative case, an insufficiently correlated generator,
an unasserted observable result, redundant implementation logic, or a genuinely
equivalent transformation. Prefer a deterministic regression plus the general
property when a survivor identifies a concrete boundary. Narrow a mutation
scope only to the implementation contract described by the registered
property; never exclude product code merely to raise the score.

Pull requests run the targets owned by changed packages. Changes to the SDK,
root toolchain, mutation governance, or CI fan out to all 25 targets. The
independent `Mutation quality` workflow runs the full matrix every Sunday and
can run one exact target manually. Targets execute in parallel, reuse one
workspace build, and preserve machine-readable reports for 30 days. Mutation
runs use the policy's fixed 300-case fast-check seed by default so the dry run
and every mutant see the same generated campaign. `FAST_CHECK_NUM_RUNS`,
`FAST_CHECK_SEED`, and `FAST_CHECK_PATH` remain available for an explicit
replay or deeper local investigation.

List and run targets locally:

```sh
pnpm test:mutation --list
pnpm test:mutation --target p2p-messages
pnpm test:mutation --all
```

The mutation score follows Stryker's valid-mutant definition: killed and timed
out mutants are detected; survived and uncovered mutants are undetected;
compile and runtime errors are excluded from the score but rejected separately
by this repository's policy. A score is a ratchet, not a substitute for
reviewing the surviving-mutant report and the semantic quality of each
generator.

Before running a governed non-PR suite, read its policy prerequisites. After the
run, perform its cleanup and attach evidence to the tracker or release record.
No private credential, production wallet data, or secret output belongs in CI
logs.
