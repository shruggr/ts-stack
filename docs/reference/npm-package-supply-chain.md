# npm Package Supply Chain

All 33 public packages are released from `.github/workflows/release.yaml`. The
workflow is the only supported publication path. It uses the protected
`npm-production` environment and npm trusted publishing (OIDC); release
automation must not use a long-lived npm write token.

## Release boundary

A release first builds and validates the workspace in an uncredentialed
`prepare` job. That job has read-only repository access, no `npm-production`
environment, no OIDC permission, and no persisted Git credentials. Package
build or lifecycle code therefore cannot mint an npm publisher token or push
repository changes.

The uncredentialed `prepare` job:

1. resolves the governed, public packages whose checked-in versions are not
   already present on npm;
2. materializes each package's publishable file set with lifecycle scripts
   disabled, canonicalizes dependency-map ordering after resolving workspace
   versions, and packs the immutable candidate once from that isolated snapshot;
3. records SHA-256, SHA-512 integrity, size, source commit, package
   identity, and topological publication order in `manifest.json`;
4. generates a production-dependency CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM for every exact
   tarball and an aggregate release SBOM;
5. creates a complete production-license inventory and rejects missing or
   high/critical restricted license declarations.

When several unpublished first-party candidates are staged together, SBOM
generation resolves their complete staged runtime and peer-dependency closure
from the local exact tarballs. It does not fall through to npm for a version
that is present in the candidate set. Resolver-only top-level dependencies are
removed from the final SBOM root relationship, so the evidence retains the
package manifest's original direct dependency and peer relationships. This
temporary resolution never rewrites or repacks the immutable publication
tarballs. Local resolver paths are removed from the final SBOM; package purls,
cryptographic hashes, licenses, and dependency relationships remain, without
leaking a runner-specific filesystem location.

Staging validates the exact governed Node.js and pnpm versions, plus the minimum
npm version, before creating the output directory or packing any candidate.
The final candidate uses the exact governed pnpm version. Canonicalization sorts
only dependency and peer-metadata maps; it preserves order-sensitive fields
such as conditional exports and verifies that the publishable file set does not
change. The transient workspace snapshot is deleted before evidence is
generated. Together these controls prevent asynchronous workspace-version
resolution from producing different bytes for equivalent package manifests.

The protected `publish` job downloads that immutable candidate, runs no package
build or lifecycle code, and:

6. scans the aggregate SBOM for high or critical vulnerability and license
   findings with Trivy;
7. creates GitHub SLSA build-provenance and CycloneDX SBOM attestations for the
   exact tarball bytes, then verifies both attestations against this repository,
   workflow, ref, and source commit;
8. retains the manifest, checksums, tarballs, SBOMs, and offline attestation
   bundles as a 90-day workflow artifact;
9. passes those same `.tgz` files to `npm publish --provenance` with lifecycle
   scripts disabled; and
10. verifies that npm exposes the same SHA-512 integrity value.

No build, pack, code-generation, or version-rewrite step may run between
attestation and publication. Published npm versions are immutable. A partial
retry skips an already-published version only when its registry digest exactly
matches the staged artifact. Registry reconciliation polls for up to ten minutes
per newly published package; the publication job has a 90-minute overall bound.
If propagation exceeds that bound, inspect registry bytes before resuming the
same candidate. A timeout does not prove that npm rejected publication.

The machine-readable contract is
`governance/npm-package-supply-chain.json`. Repository health tests ratchet the
workflow order, pinned actions, package count, scan gate, attestation
predicates, tokenless publication, and evidence policy.

## Release inputs

- `packages/<path>/vX.Y.Z` selects one governed package.
- `release/vYYYY-MM-DD` selects all governed packages.
- `vX.Y.Z` and a manual cascade release select all governed packages.
- A manual single release requires an explicit pnpm filter and must run from
  `main`.

Selection is not publication. A package is staged only when its exact
`name@version` is absent from npm. Package versions must therefore be updated
and reviewed on `main` before creating a release tag.

## Consumer verification

Download the registry tarball without installing it, then verify its GitHub
attestations:

```bash
SDK_VERSION="$(npm view @bsv/sdk version)"
npm pack "@bsv/sdk@$SDK_VERSION"

gh attestation verify "bsv-sdk-$SDK_VERSION.tgz" \
  --repo bsv-blockchain/ts-stack \
  --signer-workflow bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/.github/workflows/release.yaml \
  --predicate-type https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1

gh attestation verify "bsv-sdk-$SDK_VERSION.tgz" \
  --repo bsv-blockchain/ts-stack \
  --signer-workflow bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/.github/workflows/release.yaml \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

After installing dependencies with a lockfile, verify npm registry signatures
and npm provenance attestations:

```bash
npm audit signatures
```

For a particular release run, download the `npm-release-<run>-<attempt>`
workflow artifact to inspect the exact release manifest, per-package SBOMs,
aggregate SBOM, license inventory, checksums, and offline GitHub attestation
bundles.

## npm package settings

Each public package must configure the npm trusted publisher as:

- provider: GitHub Actions;
- organization: `bsv-blockchain`;
- repository: `ts-stack`;
- workflow filename: `release.yaml`;
- environment: `npm-production`; and
- allowed action: `npm publish`.

After trusted publishing has been confirmed for a package, its npm publishing
access should require 2FA and disallow traditional write tokens. Changing the
repository, workflow filename, environment, or package ownership requires a
coordinated update to all package settings before merging the source change.

## Failure and recovery

Do not replace an immutable version after a failed release.

- Before publication, fix the source or workflow and rerun from a reviewed
  commit.
- After partial publication, rerun the failed `publish` job within the
  candidate artifact's one-day retention window. It reuses the original
  candidate bytes; exact matching versions are verified and skipped, and
  remaining packages continue in dependency order. Publication proceeds in
  dependency waves: up to eight packages of one wave publish concurrently, and
  the next wave starts only after every package in the current wave has
  settled with registry-verified bytes, so no dependent becomes installable
  before its first-party dependencies. If the candidate has
  expired, review the published subset and prepare a deliberate recovery
  release rather than assuming newly packed bytes are identical.
- If published content is defective, deprecate the affected version and
  publish a new patch version through the normal workflow.
- Treat any registry digest mismatch, failed attestation, or unexpected
  lifecycle execution as a release-blocking security incident.
