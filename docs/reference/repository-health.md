# Repository Health Controls

The repository health controls turn the TypeScript stack maintenance program
into a checked, machine-readable contract. Root
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
`AGENTS.md`, governance registries, and CI are the current authority. Retired
[tracker #324](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/issues/324)
preserves modernization history; focused remaining work is tracked in
[QA #400](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/issues/400) and
[analysis/CI #402](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/issues/402).
The completed
[release/assurance program #401](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/issues/401)
retains its closeout evidence.

## Sources of truth

`governance/repository-health/projects.json` inventories every pnpm workspace
project. Each entry declares:

- package path and manifest name;
- accountable owner and functional area;
- package profile and runtime targets;
- criticality tier; and
- release mechanism.

The profile definitions in the same file describe the scripts and package
metadata required for Node, browser, CLI, React Native, WASM, private,
documentation, and conformance projects. Profiles standardize the externally
observable contract without requiring every package to use the same build tool.
Packages that compile authored files outside their own workspace directory
declare those paths as `sourceRoots`; CI treats a change beneath any declared
root as a direct package change, including its dedicated browser or mobile
consumer gates.

For every public package, the control also enforces the exact supported
Node.js 22 runtime floor, explicit public npm access, and an explicit
tree-shaking side-effect declaration.

`governance/documentation-policy.json` owns the public package README and
runtime-support documentation contract. `pnpm docs:facts` generates the exact
package/version/runtime/release and conformance facts, while
`pnpm docs:facts:check` rejects stale generated output, stale parity metadata,
package READMEs that do not identify, install, demonstrate, and license the
registry artifact, and missing, duplicated, version-drifted, or
pre-consolidation public package pages.

Documentation review reminders apply only to edited pages and pages associated
with directly changed sources. Elapsed dates are warnings, including on affected
pages, so an ordinary code change is never blocked just because time passed.
The separate weekly Maintenance review deadlines workflow reports documentation
and repository-exception review dates as advisory reminders. Package and service inventories supply their
page relationships; `freshness.sourcePaths` in the documentation policy maps
other pages to source files or directories. The check uses the PR merge-base
diff, the push before/after diff, or local changes against `origin/main`.
Unrelated expired pages do not block repository health. See
[Documentation Maintenance](../about/doc-agent.md) for explicit comparison and
full-audit commands. Structural and generated-content checks remain global.

Test-governance review dates are always advisory. `pnpm test:governance` and
the Repository health contract report overdue manual-suite inventories, property
suites and exclusions, mutation policy, required skips, and conformance skip
groups as `MAINTENANCE` warnings, with a successful exit when no structural
error exists. Passing a review date cannot fail the early policy gate or merge
gate for any package. Ownership, date format, exact inventories, assertions,
mutation coverage, skip counts, and removal conditions remain required. This
does not relax runtime credential, session, payment, or protocol expiration.
Review dates remain recorded; moving a deadline is not needed to unblock a PR.

`governance/repository-health/baselines.json` records the dated starting
measurements for CI, conformance, lint, TypeScript, coverage, security,
SonarCloud, governance, and published package versions. Update a measurement
only from authoritative evidence and retain the evidence URL.

The lint record retains the original 846-warning baseline while ratcheting the
current authored-code result to zero across 1,909 files. The TypeScript checker
currently tracks all 127 governed configurations and their effective strict options,
including seven self-contained deployable-service contexts. `pnpm lint` and
`pnpm typescript:check` are executable zero-debt gates; the historical counts
are evidence, not allowances.

`governance/repository-health/contract-baseline.json` contains the exact package
contract debt present when the control was introduced. The health check rejects
new findings and stale entries for findings that have been fixed. This makes
the baseline a ratchet: debt can fall, but it cannot grow silently.

The `generatedArtifacts` section of `projects.json` records each checked-in
generated boundary, its owning team, source inputs, generator, review policy,
and analysis treatment. Generated output can be excluded narrowly only when
this relationship is explicit. Product source and tests must not be
reclassified as generated to reduce quality findings.

`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` is the executable CodeQL boundary. Its
`paths-ignore` entries must exactly match the owned generated artifacts above.
The advanced workflow keeps authored JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions
analysis on pull requests, `main` pushes, and a weekly schedule with the
`security-extended` suite. The repository's Python files are deterministic
OpenAPI output under `conformance/generated/**`; their source specifications,
locked generator, and checked-in output are verified by codegen CI instead of
being misrepresented as authored Python in CodeQL. A repository-control test
rejects any loss of the authored languages, events, permissions, query
coverage, or required check names.
The advanced workflow is unconditional for each configured event. Do not gate
it on repository variables: those variables are unavailable to fork-origin
pull-request jobs, which would silently skip analysis of external contributions.
The repository-owned `Quality gate — zero new Sonar findings` job waits for
SonarCloud to report the exact pull-request head. It then requires both the
configured Sonar quality-gate verdict and zero new issue records in `OPEN`,
`CONFIRMED`, `ACCEPTED`, or `FALSE_POSITIVE` state, plus zero unreviewed
security hotspots. Including accepted and false-positive states prevents
reclassification from being used as a merge bypass. The existing required
`merge-gate` depends on this job. The gate also validates every returned issue
record client-side because SonarCloud pull-request searches can retain fixed
records even when an active-status filter is supplied; closed fixed records do
not count as new findings.

In this repository, **quality gate passed** means that strict repository-owned
check passed on the current head SHA as part of the full required CI set.
SonarCloud's green aggregate `Quality Gate passed` verdict is an advisory input
to that decision, never sufficient merge evidence by itself.

`governance/repository-health/exceptions.json` is the only registry for temporary
exceptions. Its schema is in `exception.schema.json`. Every entry requires an
owner, rationale, evidence, creation date, review deadline, and objective
removal condition. Owners must resolve to the same owner registry used by the
workspace inventory. Elapsed review dates are always advisory, including `--maintenance` and full documentation audits. An empty registry is preferred,
but existing overrides, skipped tests, and analysis suppressions must be
recorded until they are removed.

Test-specific ownership is normalized in
`governance/test-quality/policy.json`. The blocking `pnpm test:governance`
contract inventories required skips, classifies every manual/live/resource
suite, rejects empty tests, ratchets all conformance skip groups, and requires
every property-fuzz suite to declare its package, trust boundary, concrete
invariants, minimum PR budget, and reproducible long-run campaign.
`governance/mutation-testing/policy.json` then pairs all 25 property suites with
focused implementation mutation targets, per-boundary score ratchets, zero
uncovered mutants, and zero invalid mutants.

## Commands

Run the blocking control and its unit tests:

```sh
pnpm health:check
pnpm docs:facts:check
pnpm test:governance
pnpm test:property
pnpm test:mutation --all
pnpm typecheck
```

Render the complete current report:

```sh
pnpm health:report
```

After a PR actually fixes or deliberately reclassifies package-contract
findings, refresh the ratchet in that same PR:

```sh
pnpm health:baseline
pnpm health:check
```

Never refresh the baseline merely to make unexplained new debt pass. A new
temporary hold belongs in the exception registry, not in an unreviewed baseline
rewrite.

### Package artifact checks

A publishable package's `pack:check` command validates the built package rather
than its source tree. The shared checker:

1. creates the exact pnpm release tarball with lifecycle scripts disabled;
2. rejects tests, compiler caches, lockfiles, and uncompiled TypeScript in the
   payload;
3. proves that every conditional and wildcard export target is packed,
   expands every concrete public subpath, validates every referenced source
   map, and checks `sideEffects`, optional dependencies, and peer metadata;
4. runs strict `publint` metadata and entry-point validation;
5. runs the `@arethetypeswrong/core` analyzer across every strict Node and
   bundler resolution mode; and
6. installs the tarball into a clean temporary consumer, resolves every
   concrete public subpath in every supported module mode, and executes the
   declared runtime contracts. The consumer installs exact tarballs for the
   package's transitive `workspace:` runtime dependency closure, so coordinated
   unpublished version bumps cannot pass by resolving older registry releases.

Build before checking an individual package:

```sh
pnpm --filter @bsv/amountinator build
pnpm --filter @bsv/amountinator pack:check
```

CI runs implemented `pack:check` commands for affected packages after the
shared workspace build. The release workflow repeats every implemented check
before resolving or publishing a release plan. Adding a script therefore adds
a blocking release contract; it must not be a placeholder or a source-only
check.

Browser packages additionally use
`governance/browser-artifact-policy.json`. It binds every browser-bundler
consumer to its exact entry, byte budget, and reviewed optional-adapter
splitting disposition. CI retains normalized Vite/esbuild module and package
composition reports for 30 days. A budget increase is a versioned source
change requiring composition evidence and explicit review; it cannot be hidden
in routine dependency maintenance. An approved increase normally leaves at
least 10% headroom in every measured byte dimension, rounded to a stable
one-thousand-byte or five-thousand-byte boundary; any different margin needs an
explicit composition rationale.

The workspace typecheck runs after the shared build so cross-package
declarations resolve exactly as downstream consumers see them. It catches
dual-package hazards where one consumer accidentally combines the ESM and
CommonJS `@bsv/sdk` runtime/type conditions: SDK classes with private fields
must retain one nominal identity throughout a consuming application.

## CI behavior

The `Repository health contract` job runs without installing dependencies. It
checks:

1. discovery matches the exact 41-project inventory;
2. names, owners, profiles, criticality, targets, privacy, and release methods
   are internally consistent;
3. generated artifact boundaries have valid owners, sources, generators, narrow
   review/analysis policies, and exact CodeQL exclusion coverage;
4. published package versions match the recorded baseline;
5. exception records are owned and structurally valid; elapsed review dates
   are advisory maintenance warnings in every invocation, including `--maintenance`;
6. current package-contract findings exactly match the ratcheted snapshot; and
7. generated stack/conformance facts, all 33 public package README contracts,
   and one current consolidated package page per public package are current;
   and
8. the health implementation’s unit tests pass; and
9. the exact SonarCloud pull-request analysis has no new issue findings or
   unreviewed security hotspots, including findings reclassified as accepted
   or false-positive.

Changed implementation, property, regression, configuration, and policy inputs
select their exact mutation targets. The parallel mutation lane restores the
shared workspace build, executes only the focused property and regression tests
for each selected implementation boundary, retains its JSON report, and feeds
the required merge gate. Only root mutation tooling changes deliberately fan
out to the full target registry. Selector and scoring changes are exercised by
the zero-install repository contract instead of spending the same mutation
matrix merely to test which matrix was selected. A separate scheduled workflow
validates all targets weekly.

The job writes a rule-by-rule and project-by-project report to the GitHub Actions
step summary and feeds the required `merge-gate`. Known findings stay visible
until their remediation PR removes them from both the code and baseline.

## Contributor-policy control

`governance/contributor-policy.json` makes the root contribution and agent
doctrine executable. `pnpm contributor-policy:check` currently requires 47
generated root-policy pointers across governed workspace and standalone service
scopes, forbids nested `.github` ownership and
package-local contribution policies, verifies root templates/workflows, and
retains the disposition of 31 legacy agent guides, 49 imported GitHub files,
and eight superseded package policies. `pnpm contributor-policy:sync`
regenerates pointers after a project or service is added.

The root CI repository-health job runs this check before installed workspace
jobs. A new package or service cannot silently invent different lint, review,
release, dependency, documentation, migration, or agent rules.

## Completion discipline

A program checkbox is complete only after the corresponding code is merged and
the relevant test run, alert state, published artifact, or measurement proves
the stated end condition. Intent, a local-only change, or a refreshed baseline
is not completion evidence.
