## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report via GitHub Security Advisories:  
**[https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/security/advisories/new)**

Or email: **security@bsvblockchain.org**

Include:

- Affected package(s) and version(s)
- Description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept (can be shared privately)
- Whether you have a proposed fix

## Response SLA

| Step                        | Target                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledge receipt         | 3 business days                                          |
| Initial severity assessment | 5 business days                                          |
| Patch plan communicated     | 14 calendar days                                         |
| Patch released (P0/P1)      | As fast as possible, typically < 30 days                 |
| Public disclosure           | Coordinated — 90-day default window from acknowledgement |

Security fixes bypass the standard 60-day deprecation policy and are released out of band.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a 90-day coordinated disclosure window by default. If a vulnerability is being actively exploited, we reserve the right to release a patch immediately and publish the advisory simultaneously.

Reporters who follow this process responsibly will be credited in the security advisory (unless anonymity is requested).

## Scope

**In scope:**

- All packages in `packages/` (Tier 0 and Tier 1 packages are highest priority)
- Conformance runners and test infrastructure
- CI/CD workflows that handle secrets or produce signed artifacts

**High-risk paths requiring extra scrutiny (see MBGA.md §7.3):**

- Key generation, handling, and derivation
- ECDSA signing, verification, and sighash computation
- Encryption, decryption, HMAC, ECIES
- Transaction construction, BEEF parsing, BUMP/Merkle validation
- Script evaluation
- Authentication and session establishment
- Payment verification
- Any parser of untrusted network input

**Out of scope:**

- Third-party dependencies (report to the upstream maintainer)
- Issues in `Tier 3` examples that have no production impact
- Theoretical vulnerabilities with no practical exploitation path

## Security Hardening Targets

This repository follows the MBGA reliability and security programme:

- Tier 0 packages target RL5 (fuzz/property tests, threat model, signed artifacts, SBOM)
- Tier 1 packages target RL4+ with security findings tracked to closure
- Supply chain controls currently enforce frozen lockfiles, deny dependency
  lifecycle scripts by default in CI, explicitly rebuild audited native/build
  tools, run dependency review and high/critical audits, and enable Dependabot
  security updates. Container builds additionally use digest-pinned bases,
  committed locks, high/critical image gates, SPDX SBOMs, SLSA provenance,
  immutable release tags, and keyless signatures or attestations with
  verification before release completion. Automated license-policy
  enforcement and npm-package SBOM/signing remain tracked completion gates in
  the repository health program; they are not represented here as complete.

See `specs/reliability/` for per-package security status.
See `docs/reference/container-supply-chain.md` for image release and
verification procedures.
