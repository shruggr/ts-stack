## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `configureEdgePolicy` for public/allowlisted browser access, bounded
  JSON and binary bodies, concurrency, Node HTTP timeouts, and configurable
  CSP/browser response headers.

### Changed
- Public protocol endpoints now allow credential-free cross-origin browser
  calls by default. Operators can opt into exact origins or disable
  Origin-bearing calls.
- Verbose request logging records redacted headers and body size/type metadata
  instead of request bodies.

### Deprecated
- (List features that are in the process of being phased out or replaced.)

### Removed
- (Indicate features or capabilities that were taken out of the project.)

### Fixed
- Health and route failures no longer return internal exception messages.

### Security
- Added body, concurrency, connection-timeout, parser-error, and browser-header
  baselines to every route.
- Administrative Bearer tokens are compared in constant time.
- Janitor health probes now reject HTTP, redirects, credentials,
  query/fragment components, non-standard ports, and private or special IP
  literals unless the local-development override is explicitly enabled.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- Added Arcade-first transaction propagation and proof lookup, with standard Arc
  broadcast as fallback when both providers are configured.
- Added go-chaintracks-compatible Chaintracks configuration for header lookup and
  BASM reorg SSE; Arcade-mounted Chaintracks defaults to `/chaintracks/v2`.
- Added active `OverlayMonitor` maintenance actions for BASM sync, unproven
  refresh-before-evict, and janitor runs.
- Added admin endpoints for proof refresh and unproven transaction maintenance.

### Changed
- Provider callbacks now classify terminal invalid and double-spend outcomes so
  rejected transactions can be evicted from admitted overlay state.
- Production overlay-server wiring now defaults to strict broadcast admission
  (`throwOnBroadcastFailure=true`) unless explicitly overridden.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Added `OverlayMonitor`, a reusable worker for probing Overlay Express `/lookup`
  responses and reporting BEEF proof-shape bloat.

### Fixed
- ARC broadcasts now include an explicit `/arc-ingest` callback URL, with optional
  callback-token validation for deployments that configure one.

---

## [0.7.11] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Healthcheck endpoint
