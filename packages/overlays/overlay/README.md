# @bsv/overlay

The core engine and storage contracts for BSV Overlay Services. The engine admits
transactions through topic managers, maintains UTXO state, serves lookup
services, and supports SHIP, SLAP, GASP, and BASM synchronization.

Lookup history selectors retain their selected topical predecessors even when a
transaction is confirmed. The response keeps its current subject last in BRC-62
BEEF and includes the selected available history within existing traversal and
byte budgets. A lookup with no history selector returns its original proof bytes.
UMP hosts must request this lineage to let clients follow token updates past an
older WAB support pin.

Use [`@bsv/overlay-express`](../overlay-express/README.md) when you want the
standard HTTP server, operational endpoints, edge policy, and health checks.
Use this package directly when you are embedding the engine in another runtime
or implementing a custom transport.

Knex storage maps SQL `NULL` block heights to absent confirmation metadata. It never invents a confirmed height; malformed non-null values still fail engine validation.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- `@bsv/sdk` installed as a peer dependency
- A `Storage` implementation
- A `ChainTracker`, or the explicit `'scripts only'` validation mode

## Install

```bash
npm install @bsv/overlay @bsv/sdk
```

## Create an engine

```ts
import { Engine, KnexStorage } from '@bsv/overlay'
import type { LookupService, TopicManager } from '@bsv/overlay'
import knex from 'knex'

const database = knex({
  client: 'pg',
  connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL
})

const topicManagers: Record<string, TopicManager> = {
  tm_example: exampleTopicManager
}

const lookupServices: Record<string, LookupService> = {
  ls_example: exampleLookupService
}

const engine = new Engine(
  topicManagers,
  lookupServices,
  new KnexStorage(database),
  chainTracker,
  'https://overlay.example'
)

await engine.submit({
  beef: transaction.toBEEF(),
  topics: ['tm_example']
})

const answer = await engine.lookup({
  service: 'ls_example',
  query: { txid }
})
```

The constructor also accepts SHIP/SLAP trackers, broadcasters, an advertiser,
sync configuration, a logger, a topic-anchor header resolver, and BASM/unproven
state controls. Type declarations document the complete configuration surface.

## Public API

The root entry point exports:

- `Engine`
- `KnexStorage` and `KnexStorageMigrations`
- the topic-manager, lookup-service, storage, advertisement, and sync contracts
- BASM utilities and types
- safe structured-log serializers

`@bsv/overlay/storage` exports the `Storage` contract. Existing supported deep
imports remain available through the documented package export map, but new
applications should prefer the root entry point wherever possible.

## Optional persistence capability

`AdmissionStorage` defines an additive v1 atomic admission contract for future
adapters. `storageHasAdmission(storage)` reports whether the optional
`admission` field is present. `getAdmissionStorage(storage)` detects an explicit provider with both
commit and reconciliation methods. Existing Knex and injected legacy adapters
remain supported; their individual methods do not imply atomic submission.
When `getAdmissionStorage(storage)` observes a complete `overlay-admission-v1`
provider, `Engine.submit` builds an admission plan and returns the saved STEAK
only after majority commit. The SQL/Knex path and its early STEAK callback are
unchanged; that callback is not a durable commit receipt.

The contract separates local commit, index visibility and propagation. It binds
operation identity to verified transaction, topic/policy and off-chain context;
uses ready payload references and outbox intents; and fences recovery by both
chain epoch and topic history generation. Helper functions and shared fixtures
pin exact integers, deterministic identity, leases and cursor eligibility.
See the [persistence specification](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/blob/main/specs/overlay/persistence-v1.md).
No consumer migration, storage-default change or database migration is included
in this release candidate.

## Optional Mongo foundation

The package also contains an opt-in MongoDB foundation for schema bootstrap,
content-addressed payload publication, reference guards, payload collection,
and an explicit `AdmissionStorage` adapter. Mongo is not the default Engine
storage selection; importing `@bsv/overlay` alone does not load MongoDB.

Applications using a Mongo deep entry point install the optional peer first:

```sh
npm install @bsv/overlay mongodb@^7.5.0
```

The initial entry points are
`@bsv/overlay/storage/mongo/MongoSchema`,
`@bsv/overlay/storage/mongo/MongoPayloadStore`,
`@bsv/overlay/storage/mongo/MongoAdmissionStorage`, and
`@bsv/overlay/storage/mongo/MongoOverlayStorage`. They require an explicitly
operated unsharded replica set; the supported deployment profile is three
members. Payload publication makes GridFS bytes physically `published` before
the guarded payload row becomes `ready`; caller-session reference and GC
operations share that row guard. See the [Mongo v1
foundation](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/ts-stack/blob/main/specs/overlay/mongo-v1.md)
for operational bounds, recovery rules, and the opt-in admission path.

## Runtime and package formats

The package supports both module systems:

```ts
import { Engine } from '@bsv/overlay'
```

```js
const { Engine } = require('@bsv/overlay')
```

ES modules load from `dist/esm`; CommonJS loads from `dist/cjs`. Each condition
has matching declarations. Published artifacts contain compiled output, the
README, and the license only—tests, compiler caches, workspace source, and lock
files are excluded.

## Security and operations

The engine is transport-neutral. Authentication, CORS, CSP, body limits,
timeouts, rate or concurrency controls, and administrative authorization belong
at the HTTP or application boundary.

Overlay endpoints are commonly public protocol services used by browsers,
mobile wallets, WUI, and applications on previously unknown origins. A wrapper
should therefore remain public-by-default unless an operator deliberately
configures an exact-origin allowlist. CORS is not an authentication mechanism,
and CSP for a hosted UI should be configured independently.

For production deployments:

- validate all untrusted request data before invoking the engine;
- use a durable storage implementation and tested database migrations;
- configure transaction broadcast and proof providers;
- protect administrative and callback routes with explicit credentials;
- avoid logging raw secrets, authorization headers, or unbounded payloads;
- monitor readiness, proof acquisition, synchronization, and unproven state.

Run every `KnexStorageMigrations` migration before serving traffic. The topical
uniqueness migration deliberately stops when duplicate `(txid, outputIndex,
topic)` output rows or `(txid, topic)` applied-transaction rows already exist;
operators must inspect and reconcile those records rather than letting a
migration discard security-relevant state. The engine serializes submissions
inside one process, while database uniqueness and conditional unspent updates
enforce the same spend/admission boundary across processes.

Prefer roll-forward after these migrations. Older package versions do not know
their migration names, so a bare image rollback can fail migration-list
validation. To restore an older version, stop writes and either use the new
migration source to reverse `spentBy` and topical uniqueness in reverse order
after exporting and reconciling every `spent`/`spentBy` association, or restore
coordinated pre-migration SQL and lookup-store backups. Never drop `spentBy` or
restore only one store without preserving that spend evidence.

Submission is intentionally not a single all-or-nothing transaction across
primary storage and external lookup indexes. The Engine validates before
mutation, propagates failures, and never invokes the success callback until all
attempted writes complete, but a late failure does not roll back an earlier
committed write or third-party index update. A rejected submission therefore
does not assert rollback. Operators and custom adapters must detect and
reconcile partially applied work before replaying or exposing affected state.

GASP v1 bidirectional `submitNode` omits the `spentBy` parent outpoint. A
receiver must already have the relevant parent, request it in a subsequent
sync round, or reject the graph; it must never infer the edge from the child
alone. Pull-only operation avoids that assumption. The Overlay pull adapter
binds topic, graph, raw transaction, output, parent edge, proof, resource
limits, and historical spend state before finalization.

Remote GASP/BASM peers and propagation/header providers are separate network
authorities. Production adapters accept credential-free public HTTPS, pin DNS
addresses to the requested origin, reject redirects, bound streamed bodies and
deadlines, and correlate every transaction, topic, height, index, and proof to
its request. Private or HTTP targets belong only in explicit isolated local
development configurations.

Reorg event streams are hints rather than independent chain-state authority.
Before demoting a proven admission for a reported orphaned block, the Engine
requires the configured canonical header resolver to return a different hash
for that exact height. An unavailable resolver or a hash that is still
canonical rejects the event before any durable mutation.

SHIP tracker answers are discovery hints, not trusted routing authority. Before
using a discovered endpoint for GASP, the Engine now requires a canonical
identity-linked advertisement signature, a one-satoshi token, exact BEEF/TXID
correlation, and the requested topic. The endpoint still passes through the
same public-HTTPS and DNS-pinning controls as an explicitly configured peer.

Custom `Storage`, `LookupService`, `TopicManager`, advertiser, chain-tracker,
and header-resolver implementations are trusted local components, but their
runtime results are still checked before the Engine mutates or returns state.
Storage queries must return only records bound to the requested outpoint,
topic, height, block hash, and score window. Lookup formulas use a default
1,000-result limit and an unconditional 100,000-result safety ceiling; history
depth, context bytes, stored BEEF, graph fan-out, and aggregate traversal work
are also bounded. `maxLookupResults: -1` disables the operator-selected lower
limit, not the hard safety ceiling. BASM anchor stores must return strictly
ordered, request-bound, canonical hash records.

Public component metadata is copied through a bounded own-data-property schema;
names, descriptions, versions, and HTTP(S) links that are malformed, accessor
backed, or oversized fall back to a minimal local registry description.
Component Markdown documentation is limited to 1 MiB before it crosses the
Engine/HTTP boundary.

`@bsv/overlay-express` supplies these standard HTTP controls while preserving
public protocol access by default.

### BASM peer validation and current recovery limits

BASM uses the current BRC-136 ordered admitted subset and block-anchored TAC.
The five existing JSON POST routes remain compatible; empty tips remain
`{ topic, blockHeight: -1, tac: <zero hash> }`. Unsupported storage capabilities
are errors, not empty histories. The remote client validates response shape,
topic/height/hash binding, ordered unique admitted positions, contiguous
returned ranges, and complete proof/raw response ID sets before use.

`BASMRemote` retains its injectable third `fetch` argument and accepts optional
limits as a fourth argument. Defaults are 64 MiB per decoded response, 8 MiB
per proof, 32 MiB per raw transaction, 100,000 admitted entries, 1,000 requested
txids, 1,024 requested anchor heights, and 30 seconds per request including its
body. Aggregate response limits also apply to hex-encoded transactions. These
are configurable local acceptance limits, not consensus rules. Standard fetch
bodies are bounded while streaming; legacy injected `text()` implementations
are checked after buffering. Classified errors expose `code`, including
`BASM_UNSUPPORTED`, `BASM_RESOURCE_LIMIT`, and `BASM_TIMEOUT`.

Reconciliation requires a canonical header resolver as well as a ChainTracker.
An optional `TopicAnchorHeader.blockTransactionCount` must come independently
from the trusted canonical provider and refer to that exact `blockHash`.
It enables full-block count/index bounds and odd-duplication checks. The sync
report's `positionValidation` is `canonical-count` only when that evidence was
available for every checked proof; legacy providers yield `encoded-offset-only`.
A Merkle root plus an encoded offset alone cannot disambiguate Bitcoin's
duplicate-last-leaf position ambiguity. No provider is required to add the
field, and the engine does not download full blocks to infer it.

Forward sync pages now contain at most 1,000 anchors to fit the standard HTTP
server. Proof height, requested original index, canonical hash/root, raw byte
identity, TAC continuity, and repeated peer anchors are checked before historical
submission. Claimed admitted-list indices are bound to the compound path whenever
a remote list is used as evidence, including when every remote txid is already
local. Inclusion uses the chain tracker root/height check rather than
`MerklePath.verify`, which also enforces coinbase 100-block spendability.
Because inclusion is proven independently, admission submits in the
`historical-tx-no-spv` mode so `Transaction.verify` does not re-apply that
coinbase rule; the public `historical-tx` mode keeps full SPV verification.
Admission still applies the local TopicManager, and because every admitted
transaction carries its extracted Merkle path, neither network broadcast nor
overlay propagation occurs. Automatic BASM sync remains disabled by default.

This is bounded protocol hardening, not durable recovery. An empty local node
whose topic genesis precedes the recent bootstrap window now refuses the
untrusted TAC prefix; this intentionally replaces the old unchecked tail
behavior. A block above 1,000 admitted entries reaches a request-limit error
until proof/raw chunking is implemented. Equal-height/local-ahead divergence,
whole-target bootstrap, durable cursors/leases, atomic revision fencing, and
truthful per-topic agreement status remain required follow-up work. A successful
legacy report does not establish global completeness, current unspentness, or
durable recovery completion. See [BASM details](./docs/BRC-136-BASM.md).

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay format:check
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay lint
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay typecheck
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay test
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay test:coverage
pnpm --filter @bsv/overlay pack:check
```

`pack:check` verifies the actual npm tarball with publint, strict type
resolution, and clean ESM/CommonJS consumer projects.
