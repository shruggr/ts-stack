## Known Issues & Incidents

- **Test coverage is critically low** (3 test files / 21 source files). Phase 1 priority: expand before Phase 2 contract work.
- Core engine for all overlay services — regressions here cascade widely.

## Conformance Vectors

No vectors exist yet. Phase 2 target: overlay Topic Manager + Lookup Service contract interface vectors.
