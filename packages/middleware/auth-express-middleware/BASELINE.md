## Reliability and security controls

- Strict attacker-controlled handshake/header validation before state allocation
- Bounded request, certificate, verification, and response-signing state
- Configurable pending-request capacity and timeout
- Stable public errors without internal wallet/signing/storage messages
- Metadata-only optional logging; no raw auth headers, signatures,
  certificates, bodies, wallet objects, or peer objects
- Shared `AsyncSessionManager` supported and documented for scaled services
- Deterministic local AuthFetch and certificate integration coverage
- Public handshake path exact-matched; no hard-coded CORS/CSP restriction

## Remaining program work

- Repository-wide conformance/vector work remains tracked in the main stack
  health program.
- Publication, release notes, and rollback evidence are deferred until explicit
  release approval. No npm publication is part of this baseline.
