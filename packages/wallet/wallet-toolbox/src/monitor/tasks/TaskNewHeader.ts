/**
 * This task polls for new block headers performing two essential functions:
 * 1. The arrival of a new block is the right time to check for proofs for recently broadcast transactions.
 * 2. The height of the block is used to limit which proofs are accepted with the aim of avoiding re-orged proofs.
 *
 * The most common new block orphan is one which is almost immediately orphaned.
 * Waiting a minute before pursuing proof requests avoids almost all the re-org work that could be done.
 * Thus this task queues new headers for one cycle.
 * If a new header arrives during that cycle, it replaces the queued header and delays again.
 * Only when there is an elapsed cycle without a new header does proof solicitation get triggered,
 * with that header height as the limit for which proofs are accepted.
