# wallet-toolbox Significant Changes History

This document captures the history of significant changes to the wallet-toolbox repository.
The git commit history contains the details but is unable to draw
attention to changes that materially alter behavior or extend functionality.

## wallet-toolbox (unreleased)

- Add capability-negotiated action-batch manifest format 2 without changing
  BRC-100. It derives source/output scripts from the authenticated transaction
  graph, retains only the external proof frontier, bulk-loads shared storage
  rows, and commits an already prepared manifest by semantic digest. Version-1
  providers and clients retain their existing behavior.
- Add authenticated `ABP1` multi-blob uploads with bounded gzip/Brotli/identity
  negotiation, decompression limits, prepared-manifest authorization, per-item
  content verification, bounded concurrency, and one-transaction bulk storage.
  The physical request limit chunks unbounded logical transactions; it is not
  a script or consensus limit.
- Add optional script-verifier injection to Wallet, setup helpers, and local
  storage providers. Internal checks use explicit consensus context, distinguish
  resource exhaustion from invalid scripts, and continue verifying resolvable
  inputs when another source transaction is intentionally omitted.
- Retain typed bytes through action-batch planning, hashing, validation, and
  chunk assembly; preload external inputs and shared metadata once per atomic
  manifest; and convert Atomic BEEF only at the historical public `number[]`
  boundary without changing BRC-100 or storage protocol contracts.
- Make StorageServer, AdminServer, and the reusable ChaintracksService
  credential-free public-CORS compatible by default, with opt-in exact origin
  lists and configurable CSP/browser response headers. Add bounded parsers,
  in-flight work and Node connection limits, stable non-sensitive errors, and
  metadata-only request logging. Storage RPC work remains protected by
  BRC-103 identity, per-IP/per-identity limits, method allowlisting, and
  optional payment policy.
- Bound StorageServer work per source IP before BRC-103 authentication and per
  identity before payment/RPC handling. Both stages support shared stores, and
  proxy trust now requires an explicit hop/subnet/predicate configuration.
- Harden CWI/WAB account continuity so overlay failures, malformed or ambiguous
  UMP results, and snapshot-load failures cannot silently enter new-user
  onboarding. Add an expiring WAB auth session, legacy-compatible WAB account
  status inference, canonical E.164 phone identity, bounded KDF/snapshot
  parsing, and fail-closed UMP renewal/broadcast behavior.
- Replace WAB's endpoint-by-endpoint raw `fetch` calls with one typed transport
  enforcing HTTPS (localhost excepted), timeouts, request/response limits,
  redirect and ambient-credential protection, correlation IDs, and privacy-safe errors.
  Wallet authentication, UMP, WAB, and snapshot events now support the SDK's
  opt-in generic telemetry sink without reporting keys, snapshots, payloads,
  OTPs, or Shamir shares.
- Add automatically negotiated, in-memory planning for dependent `noSend` workloads. Capable
  storage providers reserve funding once, perform middle action planning and signing without
  persistence round trips, and atomically commit the complete workspace on `sendWith`. Existing
  BRC-100 arguments and results are unchanged, and providers without `actionBatch: 1` retain the
  legacy path. SQLite, MySQL/Knex, IndexedDB, authenticated remote clients, browser, and mobile
  builds share the same capability contract.
- Add leased per-output batch reservations, expiry cleanup, adaptive pool extension, idempotent
  manifest commits, inline content-addressed blobs up to 4 MiB, and authenticated binary uploads
  in provider-sized chunks with four-way bounded concurrency for larger batches. Broadcast remains
  outside the atomic persistence transaction.
- Make batch funding converge on fragmented wallets at production fee rates. Reservation targets
  include the fee and viable-change overhead of an added input, reactive extensions request only
  the remaining shortfall, and EWMA runway extensions subtract unconsumed reserved funding without
  compounding after empty or partial responses. The regression runs 16 independent actions through
  both the in-process and authenticated remote-storage paths and commits the complete batch.
- Bind remote batch authorization exclusively to the BRC-103 authenticated identity and its active
  storage provider, ignoring caller-supplied user IDs and active-state claims. Restrict JSON-RPC
  dispatch to the public remote-storage protocol so authenticated callers cannot invoke low-level
  provider methods, and rate-limit authenticated RPCs per identity key without limiting workspace
  length. Unauthenticated and cross-user batch-management regressions cover the boundary.
- Replace the cumulative 64-output reservation ceiling with repeatable extensions bounded to 64
  outputs per storage call. Workspaces and spend chains no longer have an action-count or confirmed
  funding-input ceiling; an 80-action independent batch crosses the old boundary and commits.
- Add a retained workload benchmark covering 1, 10, 50, and 250 actions across dependent,
  independent, mixed-input, and two-step signing models, four script sizes, and 25/100/250 ms
  storage latency. Run it with `pnpm --filter @bsv/wallet-toolbox bench:action-batch`.
- Release prep for `2.4.2`: transaction-pipeline, BEEF fetching, and binary transport
  performance improvements described below, published in lockstep for Node, browser, and mobile.
- Transaction pipeline performance: reuse parsed BEEF through `createAction`/`signAction`, retain
  typed bytes internally until persistence compatibility boundaries, and avoid reparsing Atomic
  BEEF during internalization and broadcast preparation.
- Fetch independent BEEF ancestor frontiers and allocated-change proofs with bounded concurrency,
  deterministic merge order, Set-based deduplication, and configurable `maxConcurrency`.
- Negotiate compact base64 JSON-RPC binary values across Node, browser, and mobile clients while
  preserving numeric-array requests and responses for old servers and clients. A 1 MiB payload is
  62.7% smaller on the wire than legacy byte-array JSON.
- Treat non-finite ancestor-fetch concurrency values as the safe default instead of silently
  returning incomplete BEEF, reject malformed binary JSON base64, and decode deeply nested JSON
  iteratively so hostile input cannot overflow the JavaScript call stack.
- Keep binary JSON-RPC requests in the legacy numeric-array format by default so rolling deployments
  cannot route a negotiated request to an older server instance. Homogeneous endpoints can opt in to
  compact requests with `StorageClientOptions.binaryRequests`; compact responses remain negotiated.

- Release prep for `2.4.2`: add a Knex-backed async BRC-103 session manager,
  the shared-session schema migration, and `StorageServer.sessionManager`
  injection so authenticated requests can move safely between replicas without
  sticky routing. Session writes reject stale cross-replica state, expire after
  a configurable TTL, and support explicit pruning. Also add an opt-out that
  skips both per-RPC logging and request-parameter serialization, and add a
  `monitor_events.created_at` index for production proof-latency correlation.
  Declare the runtime `body-parser` and `dotenv` imports explicitly;
  `auth-express-middleware@2.1.1` likewise declares its `mime-types` runtime
  import so strict package managers do not fail when loading the built packages.

 - Release prep for `2.4.2`: proof completion now discovers every local
   transaction row sharing the proven txid, repairs notification-set drift from
   concurrent multi-user `internalizeAction` calls, and idempotently completes
   any local copy omitted by a last-writer-wins notification update.

- Release prep for `2.4.1`: define one managed-change policy across Knex and IndexedDB allocation,
  counting, default balance reporting, `balanceAndUtxos`, and `noSendChange`.
  Only complete BRC-29 signer metadata is eligible; custom rows remain visible
  through raw default-basket listing for recovery. `internalizeAction` now
  rejects basket insertion into `default`, prevents managed change from being
  reclassified, promotes verified legacy BRC-29 rows through `wallet payment`,
  and permits incompatible custom rows to be swept to non-default baskets
  without changing wallet balance.

- Release prep for `2.4.0`: security fix for `GHSA-36f9-7rg5-cpf8`. `buildSignableTransaction` now verifies that storage-returned outputs match the caller's requested `args.outputs` before signing (rejects substituted/altered/reclassified/missing outputs), and rejects any unrequested output that isn't client-derived change or a single commission output bounded by `MAX_STORAGE_COMMISSION_SATOSHIS`. `WalletPermissionsManager.createAction` independently verifies requested outputs are present in the signable transaction before authorizing, as defense-in-depth. Protects against a malicious or compromised `StorageClient` operator substituting or injecting outputs that would be signed and broadcast without the caller's knowledge.

- Release prep for `2.3.3`: add Arcade-first wallet service wiring, go-chaintracks
  live client/SSE support, resilient ARC/Arcade status handling, monitor
  rebroadcast safeguards, and callback-token redaction for Arcade SSE logs.

- **Public API change**: `AbortActionResult.aborted` is now typed `boolean` (was the literal `true`). The wallet returns `aborted: false` when it positively confirms the underlying transaction is already on chain (mined or known to mempool) and the abort therefore should not proceed. Callers branching on `result.aborted` should treat `false` as "refused due to on-chain confirmation" and typically follow up with `internalizeAction`. Service-unreachable conditions return `aborted: true` (with an `abortAction-offline-fallback` history note) — refusal is reserved for positive on-chain confirmation, per BRC-100.

- Fix: close the nosend orphan-output failure mode. A `nosend` transaction (created via `createAction({noSend:true})`) could be externally broadcast and confirmed on chain before any `internalizeAction` or `Monitor.TaskCheckNoSends` cycle retired its `nosend` status. Before this change, two paths could then destroy the wallet's bookkeeping for the chain-confirmed tx: `StorageProvider.abortAction` unconditionally promoted `transactions.status` to `'failed'` and `proven_tx_reqs.status` to terminal `'invalid'`, hiding every output the tx produced (including the wallet's own auto-fund change) from the `listOutputsKnex` `txStatusAllowed` filter; and `specOpNoSendActions.postProcess` (bulk-abort path) blanket-set `tx.status = 'failed'` regardless of per-row outcome. Additionally `mergedInternalize` never advanced `transactions.status` or `proven_tx_reqs.status` out of `nosend`, so even a correctly-issued post-broadcast `internalizeAction` silently no-op'd on the lifecycle. Four fixes in defense-in-depth: (1) `mergedInternalize` retires the nosend lifecycle (transition to `unproven` + req `unmined`, or all the way to `completed` if the BEEF carries a BUMP); (2) `Monitor.processNewBlockHeader` now nudges `TaskCheckNoSends.checkNow` alongside the existing `TaskCheckForProofs.checkNow` nudge, wiring up the documented-but-orphaned per-block trigger; (3) `StorageProvider.abortAction` chain-checks signed `nosend` txs via `services.getStatusForTxids` and returns `aborted: false` for `mined` or `known` (mempool-aware) txs without throwing; (4) `specOpNoSendActions.postProcess` pre-filters chain-known rows before bulk-abort and honors per-row `aborted: false` returns so race-window rows that became chain-known mid-page leave their status as `nosend` rather than being blanket-set to `failed`. Service-unreachable handling proceeds with the abort and writes an `abortAction-offline-fallback` history note for forensic audit — abort must remain possible when network confirmation is impossible. One residual edge case (backend returns success+`unknown` for a tx that is actually on chain) is documented in the PR; mitigations include the per-block `TaskCheckNoSends` nudge eventually self-healing and caller-side multi-source chain verification.

- Optimization: `TaskCheckNoSends` aging schedule on the block-triggered `checkNow` path. The unfiltered per-block scan would do an unbounded number of external `getMerklePath` lookups per block as a wallet's `nosend` set grows (escrow, un-aborted tests, abandoned batches). The new schedule keys on row age: rows fresher than 5 min are skipped entirely (protecting in-flight batched-tx workflows that chain `createAction({noSend:true, sendWith:[...]})` builds); 5 min – 1 hr rows check on every trigger; older rows progress to `~hourly` (block-height % 6), `~daily` (% 144), and `~weekly` (% 1008) cadences. Each row's modulo offset is keyed by its `provenTxReqId` so same-tier rows are staggered across the cycle (`(blockHeight + provenTxReqId) % tierInterval === 0`) rather than all firing on the same block. The scheduled daily (no-`checkNow`) cadence is unchanged and still scans every row, providing a safety net for externally-broadcast unmined `nosend` txs regardless of age.

## wallet-toolbox 2.1.27

- Add optional `contactSource` (and exported `ContactSource` / `ContactRecord` interfaces) on `WalletArgs` and the `Wallet` class. When provided, `Wallet.discoverByIdentityKey` consults the local contacts source **before** the in-process `_overlayCache` and before any network call; on a hit, the overlay is not queried at all. `Wallet.discoverByAttributes` consults the contact source's optional `findByAttributes` when present. Contact-source failures are swallowed and fall through to the existing network path so the network is never gated on a flaky contact store.
- `Wallet.discoverByIdentityKey` and `Wallet.discoverByAttributes` accept `forceRefresh?: boolean`. When `true`, both the contacts short-circuit and the 2-minute `_overlayCache` are bypassed so the network is consulted fresh — useful for a manual refresh action.
- `identityUtils.parseResults` now yields to the host runtime between certificates on UI runtimes (browser / React Native, detected at call time). On Node the yield is skipped to avoid timer overhead. Same total work; the JS thread no longer owns the frame for the duration of the loop, so menu taps and scroll keep working while a large identity result is parsed.
- `identityUtils.parseResults$` — new async-iterable form that emits each successfully parsed `VerifiableCertificate` as soon as it's ready, for callers that want progressive rendering.
- `queryOverlay` widens the per-call grace window for `ls_identity` queries to 300 ms via the new `LookupQueryOptions.graceMs`, so more in-sync identity hosts contribute outputs before the query resolves.
- `@bsv/sdk` dependency switched to the local workspace via `workspace:^2.1.1` so SDK changes flow through without an intermediate publish. Publish-time tooling rewrites `workspace:` ranges to concrete versions.

## wallet-toolbox 2.1.26

- Fix: auto-evict confirmed-stale inputs after any failed broadcast, regardless of how the broadcaster classifies the failure. When a tx is marked failed, `updateTransactionStatus(failed)` previously restored ALL consumed inputs to `spendable: true` to support transient retry. That's correct for fee/script/malformed failures where inputs are still UTXOs, but wrong for cases where the input has been spent on chain by a different tx — the wallet then picks the same already-spent UTXO on the next createAction → infinite missing-inputs broadcast loop. The new `markStaleInputsAsSpent` helper runs after `updateTransactionsStatus(failed)` and queries `services.isUtxo` per consumed input (concurrently across inputs via `Promise.all`), overriding `spendable: false` only for inputs the chain authoritatively confirms are spent. Inputs still on chain (transient/false-positive failures) keep the existing retry semantics. Service errors leave inputs untouched (eviction is opt-in based on positive evidence). Helper is broadcaster-agnostic — applies to ARC's `doubleSpend` (`SEEN_IN_ORPHAN_MEMPOOL`) and to WhatsOnChain/Bitails `invalidTx` (`missing-inputs`) classifications alike. Pre-broadcast races where concurrent createActions reach the same UTXO across separate app processes remain out of scope; that's a separate class of double-spend with its own design space (TaskReviewUtxos enqueue, locked-input semantics).

### Add `teratest` and `mock` chain types

- Change `Chain` type from `'main' | 'test'` to `'main' | 'test' | 'teratest' | 'mock'`.

**`teratest` chain:**

- Add ARC URL `https://arc-teratest.taal.com` for the teratest network.
- Chaintracks URL follows existing `${chain}net-chaintracks.babbage.systems` pattern.
- WhatsOnChain URL follows existing `https://api.whatsonchain.com/v1/bsv/${network}` pattern.
- Bitails is not available on teratest (only `main` and `test`).

**`mock` chain — full self-contained mock blockchain:**

- Add new `src/mockchain/` module with `MockServices`, `MockChainTracker`, `MockMiner`, `MockChainStorage`, and merkle tree utilities.
- `MockServices` implements the `WalletServices` interface against a local SQLite database (3 tables: `mockchain_block_headers`, `mockchain_transactions`, `mockchain_utxos`).
- Transactions are validated with full script execution via `@bsv/sdk` `Transaction.verify()`.
- Coinbase maturity rule enforced (100 block confirmations required before spending).
- On-demand block mining via `MockServices.mineBlock()`.
- Chain reorganization simulation via `MockServices.reorg()` with `txidMap` for controlling which transactions land in which new blocks.
- Add `TaskMineBlock` monitor task for periodic mining (10 minutes) with `mineNow` static flag for on-demand triggering.
- `Monitor.services` type widened from `Services` to `Services | WalletServices` to support mock chain.
- `Services` class, `createDefaultWalletServicesOptions`, and external service providers (`WhatsOnChain`, `Bitails`) throw explicit errors if instantiated with `'mock'` chain.

**Explicit chain handling across codebase:**

- Convert chain-dependent ternaries to explicit switch statements in `toWalletNetwork`, `genesisHeader`, `Bitails` constructor, WoC WebSocket ingestors, and `ChaintracksStorageNoDb`.
- Each chain value (`main`, `test`, `teratest`, `mock`) is handled explicitly rather than falling through a catch-all else branch.

Changes to improve computing balances (sum of satoshis) over various sets of wallet spendable outputs:

- Added optional ListOutputsArgs argument to Wallet balance method. This enables using the same arguments in a call to listOutputs and balance. This method injects the specOpWalletBalance string constant into the appropriate basket or tag property and returns totalOutputs as its result.
- Fully optimized specOpWalletBalance processing within listOutputsKnex to use SQL sum(satoshis). Much faster than returning arrays of outputs and summing WalletOutput results.

### Change in Handling of New Outputs NOT Assigned to a Basket

New outputs created by `createAction` / `signAction` that are NOT assigned to a basket are considered immediately SPENT.

Implications:

- Outputs transferred to a second party, either through internalizeAction or custom means, MUST NOT be assigned to a basket
  as this allows them to be spent without your wallet being notified that they are no longer spendable. This is a usage guideline, it is not enforced.
- These outputs will NOT be returned by `listOutputs`, as it only returns spendable outputs.
- These outputs WILL be returned by `listActions` with the includeOutputs option set to true.
- Your wallet will mark any output you include as inputs in your own transactions as spent at the time of transaction creation.
- If a created transaction subsequently fails to be broadcast (abandoned or invalid), the outputs are reset to spendable. This may not happen immediately.
