# wallet-toolbox Significant Changes History

This document captures the history of significant changes to the wallet-toolbox repository.
The git commit history contains the details but is unable to draw
attention to changes that materially alter behavior or extend functionality.

## wallet-toolbox 2.15.0

- `StorageKnex` runs on Postgres through the knex `pg` client. Settings report
  `dbtype: 'Postgres'`, and `StorageClient` accepts that value from a remote
  `StorageServer`; older clients reject it. Install `pg` in the application.
- On a Postgres knex, `StorageKnex` sets an int8 parser on each connection it
  acquires, so bigint columns and counts come back as numbers, as with mysql2
  and better-sqlite3. The process-wide `pg.types` defaults are not changed.
  `usePostgresInt8Numbers(knex)` applies the same parser to a knex directly, and
  `Setup.createPostgresKnex(connectionJson, database)` creates one with it.
- Postgres runs at READ COMMITTED. The findOrInsert helpers retry a failed
  insert as a find in the same transaction; on Postgres the insert now runs in
  a savepoint so the transaction stays usable. `allocateChangeInput` re-checks
  action batch reservations after taking the output row lock.
- On Postgres, migrations that add indexes to existing tables run outside a
  transaction and use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS`; an invalid
  index left by an interrupted build is dropped and rebuilt. `StorageKnex.migrate`
  runs Postgres migrations one at a time so every other migration keeps its
  journal row in its own transaction. SQLite and MySQL migrations are unchanged.
- `adminStats` and the admin server's proof request review run on MySQL and
  Postgres. `adminStats` still reports `WERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` on SQLite.
- `MonitorDaemon` accepts `postgresConnection` (JSON node-postgres config), and
  the operator `monitor-daemon` command accepts `--database-client postgres`.
- `ChaintracksStorageKnex` rejects a Postgres knex before running migrations.
- Paged `StorageKnex` find queries and the `get*ForUser` sync queries order rows
  by key. Without an order, Postgres could return consecutive LIMIT/OFFSET pages
  in different orders, so `getSyncChunk` repeated some rows and skipped others.
- `StorageServer.app` is public, so a host can mount the storage server in its
  own Express application (`hostApp.use('/storage', server.app)`) instead of
  calling `start()`. `port` is optional and only required by `start()`.
- `preRpcMiddleware` adds Express handlers on `POST /` after authentication,
  the authenticated rate limit and payment, immediately before JSON-RPC
  dispatch. A handler that responds stops the call before dispatch.
- `publicRoutes: false` removes the unauthenticated `GET /`, `/robots.txt` and
  `/healthz` routes. Defaults are unchanged.

- Knex storage adds a unique index on `sync_states` (`userId`,
  `storageIdentityKey`). Concurrent `findOrInsertSyncStateAuth` calls for a new
  source could each insert a row, after which every sync with that source failed
  with `Storage identity has conflicting sync states`. The losing insert now
  re-reads the row that won. The migration deletes existing duplicates, keeping
  the oldest row; when the duplicates had different storage names, the kept row
  restarts as a new sync state because its checkpoint may belong to a different
  source database.
- BRC-38 import keeps one sync state per storage identity. An export holding
  several for one identity imports the oldest under the same rule, and merge
  updates the target's row for that identity even when its storage name differs.
- `WalletPermissionsManager` retires no-send transaction ownership and reference
  aliases when `createAction` or `signAction` reports them as `sending` or
  `unproven`, including sendWith-only calls and successful members of an
  undelayed batch's review error. Failed or unreported actions retain their
  originator binding for retry or abort. Cleanup visits only the retired
  transaction's references instead of scanning the session's history.

## wallet-toolbox 2.14.4

- `discoverByIdentityKey` and `discoverByAttributes` keep each certificate's
  `certifierInfo.description` within BRC-100's 5-50 UTF-8 bytes. The default
  SocialCert (56 bytes) and Metanet Trust Services (55 bytes) descriptions
  exceeded it, so `@bsv/sdk` 2.8.8+ rejected every discovery result from one of
  them with `Invalid discoverByAttributes result
certificates[n].certifierInfo.description: expected 5–50 UTF-8 bytes`, which
  broke `IdentityClient.resolveByAttributes` and `resolveByIdentityKey`. Both
  defaults are shortened. Trust settings still accept descriptions of up to 500
  bytes so stored settings stay readable; a longer one is cut at a code point
  boundary when the result is built, and one under 5 bytes becomes
  `Trusted certifier`.
- A non-admin `createAction` with `noSend` that `WalletPermissionsManager`
  signs internally returned `noSendChange` outpoints on the unsigned txid next
  to the signed `txid`, so `@bsv/sdk` 2.8.8+ rejected it with `Invalid
createAction result noSendChange[0]: expected an outpoint of the returned
transaction`. The outpoints now name the signed transaction (vouts are
  unchanged by signing).
- That same no-send action could not be released: the caller only gets its
  `txid`, and `abortAction` from a non-admin originator accepted only references
  the manager had issued, which it drops once it signs. The originator that
  created a no-send action can now abort it by that `txid`; other originators
  still cannot, and a broadcast action is never abortable this way. The same
  applies when the caller signs a `signAndProcess: false` no-send action itself
  with `signAction`: it can then abort it by the `reference` it signed or by the
  signed `txid`, where before `abortAction` failed with `The action reference
was not issued by this permissions manager.`
- `discoverByIdentityKey` and `discoverByAttributes` return the requested
  `limit`/`offset` page (limit 10 when omitted). They returned every trusted
  match, and `@bsv/sdk` rejects a page longer than the limit. `totalCertificates`
  still counts every trusted match.
- `ChaintracksServiceClient`, `BHServiceClient` and `GoChaintracksServiceClient`
  called `fetch` as a method of the client, which browsers refuse ("Failed to
  execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Illegal invocation" in Chrome, "Can only call
  Window.fetch on instances of Window" in WebKit). Any in-page wallet verifying
  a merkle proof through them failed, for example `internalizeAction` of a BRC-29
  payment. They now call the default or supplied `fetch` with no receiver.

## wallet-toolbox 2.14.3

- Surplus change shaping no longer splits change into outputs below the dust
  floor. Baskets still on the legacy 32-sat `minimumDesiredUTXOValue` produced
  split outputs that were later folded away, leaving a fee sized for the larger
  transaction and failing with `generateChangeSdk error: required fee error`.
  Each split output now gets at least `max(dustFloor, changeInitialSatoshis)`.
- `WalletPermissionsManager.abortAction` lets the admin originator abort any of
  the wallet's actions, including signed `noSend` actions and actions from an
  earlier session, which the in-memory pending-reference map no longer holds.
  Other originators still need a reference this manager issued to them.

## wallet-toolbox 2.14.2

- Match complete English text tokens and default stopwords consistently with SDK 2.8.7; preserve quoted and excluded phrases. Scan ordered literal tokens without a combined wildcard expression. Direct filtering ignores inherited attributes and rejects non-string requested values without coercion.

- `discoverByAttributes` no longer drops every overlay result for `any`
  searches. `filterCertificatesByAttributes` treated the identity overlay's
  all-fields `any` search as a literal field name, so no certificate matched.
  It now accepts a certificate when searchable decrypted fields satisfy the requested text terms,
  and named attributes use the overlay's fuzzy matching (`userName` stays
  exact). `any` follows the overlay's MongoDB text search: case- and
  diacritic-insensitive, quoted phrases required, `-term` excluded, and
  `profilePhoto`/`icon` not searched. Word stemming is not reproduced, so a
  stem-only overlay match can still be dropped. Blank named attributes are
  ignored, as on the overlay; a query with no usable attribute matches nothing.
  Results are still bound to the query they answered.

## wallet-toolbox 2.14.1

- Keep exact action-spend metadata in a shared local WeakMap, preserving storage
  service-charge authorization across permission-module transforms and separately
  loaded core, client and mobile bundles without adding keys to public results.
- Consume the legacy internal Symbol before returning permission-managed results.
  Completed and two-step `createAction` responses now pass the existing strict
  binary BRC-100 codec. No app, wire, database, BRC-39 or recovery migration is
  required; upgrade the wallet host and permission manager together. Reconcile
  history before retrying an older host's failed response because the transaction
  may already exist.

## wallet-toolbox (unreleased)

- Raise the `@bsv/sdk` peer dependency floor to `^2.8.0` in `@bsv/wallet-toolbox`,
  `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client`, and `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-mobile`. Value imports
  used by the built mobile/client bundles and by internal helpers
  (`TransactionEvidenceCoordinator`, `TransactionEvidenceError`,
  `completeBoundAction`, `createPublicHTTPSFetch`, `decodeCanonicalPushDrop`,
  `defaultTransactionEvidenceLimits`, `toUTF8Strict`,
  `MAXIMUM_SEND_WITH_TRANSACTIONS`) do not exist in `@bsv/sdk` 2.4.1 through
  2.7.1 despite the prior `^2.4.1` peer range; confirmed against the published
  tarballs for each version.
- `Monitor`'s scheduler no longer stops running every task when the optional
  Chaintracks header/reorg push subscription setup fails or is unimplemented.
  `runOnce`/`startTasks` previously awaited `ready` directly, so any
  `chaintracksWithEvents` failure (e.g. the built-in HTTP-polling
  `ChaintracksServiceClient`, which documents `supportsReorgEvents: false` and
  throws `Method not implemented.` from `subscribeHeaders`/`subscribeReorgs`)
  rejected the whole task loop and permanently stopped `startTasks()`. Monitor
  now skips the subscription attempt entirely when an event source declares
  `supportsReorgEvents: false`, and otherwise retries subscription setup
  opportunistically on the next tick, logging a `chaintracksEventsError`
  monitor event, while every other scheduled task keeps running. A genuine
  configured-chain mismatch still fails closed: subscriptions are never
  registered against a `chaintracksWithEvents` source reporting the wrong
  chain.
- Confirm `relinquishOutput`'s `basket` argument against the output's actual
  current basket (looked up inside the same transaction) before clearing
  `basketId`, instead of clearing it unconditionally. Rejects a basket that
  does not contain the output, a basket name that does not exist, and an
  already-unbasketed output, each with `WERR_INVALID_PARAMETER`. Without this,
  `WalletPermissionsManager.relinquishOutput` (which only checks the
  originator's access to the _claimed_ basket) let an app with permission on
  any basket relinquish any output by outpoint, including another app's basket
  output or the admin `default` change basket.
- Reject `internalizeAction` basket-insertion merges that would reclassify an
  existing output out of a different basket it already occupies, closing a gap
  where `validateBasketMerges()` only rejected reclassifying wallet-managed
  change. An app with insertion permission on basket X could previously
  internalize an already-known transaction and move another app's output from
  basket Y into X, then spend it. Idempotent re-internalization into the same
  basket, and inserting a currently unbasketed (non-managed-change) output —
  including the documented default-basket legacy-recovery sweep — keep
  working. The requested basket is resolved with a plain lookup so a rejected
  request never creates it.
- Fix `WalletPermissionsManager` rejecting every sendMax `createAction` call.
  `verifyRequestedOutputsPresent` now matches fixed-amount outputs first by
  exact (script, satoshis), then matches any output requested with the
  `maxPossibleSatoshis` sentinel by locking script alone against whatever is
  left unused, and returns the resolved real amount per requested output.
  `computeNetSpend` bills that resolved amount instead of the sentinel, so
  spending authorization reflects the real funded value (previously ~21
  million BSV) instead of throwing `The transaction returned for signing does
not contain caller-requested output ...`.
- Additively export `WalletMonitorTask`, `attemptToPostReqsToNetwork` (with its
  `PostReqsToNetworkResult` type), `parseJsonRpc`/`stringifyJsonRpc`, and
  `verifyUnlockScripts` (with its `UnlockScriptVerificationResult` type) from
  `src/index.mobile.ts` and `src/index.client.ts`. The published
  `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-mobile` and `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-client` bundles do not
  support deep imports, so hosts implementing a custom `Monitor.addTask` task,
  posting signed requests to the network directly, exchanging the storage
  remoting wire format, or verifying unlock scripts previously could not reach
  these symbols at all.
- Keep cold raw-transaction reads on the caller's transaction, including SQLite
  with one connection; do not cache uncommitted settings or start background
  work. Accept missing optional inputBEEF when returning stored raw bytes.
- Reject unresolved output-basket mappings before sync writes. Apply valid newer
  basket assignments/removals, preserving equal/older local relinquishment and
  transaction rollback/retry. Included in unpublished 2.13.2; no schema migration.
- Restore transactional SQLite migrations in the unpublished 2.13.2 candidate.
  DDL, migration journal and lock changes roll back after an interrupted attempt;
  foreign-key enforcement is restored after success or failure. Existing stores
  with unjournaled partial schema need operator-reviewed recovery; this change
  does not delete or automatically reconcile historical wallet data.

- Implement `BHServiceClient.findChainTipHash()` by delegating to its existing
  `findChainTipHeader()` call against `/api/v1/chain/tip/longest`, instead of
  throwing `Not implemented`. `ChaintracksChainTracker.getVerificationContextToken()`
  calls `findChainTipHash()` on every verification attempt, so any wallet
  configured with a `BHServiceClient` as `options.chaintracks`, or as a
  `LocalChainTracker` participating source, previously failed on every
  attempt. No `ChaintracksClientApi` contract change; no migration required.

- Preserve valid compound proofs with multiple marked transactions. Rotate
  unresolved proof repairs behind waiting heights across monitor restarts, and
  retain retries that become temporarily ineligible after the chain tip
  retreats. Existing checkpoints remain compatible; no migration is required.

- Validate every newly acquired and replacement Merkle proof against the active
  ChainTracks root before persistence, continue to later providers when an
  earlier provider returns an orphan proof, and retain unresolved reorg heights
  for bounded per-run retries without stopping the forward review cursor. No
  schema or consumer migration is required.

- Require mutually authenticated responses from remote wallet storage, pin the
  authenticated server identity for each client instance, optionally accept an
  independently validated `serverIdentityKey`, and bind the distinct advertised
  storage identity to that channel, with an optional independent
  `storageIdentityKey` pin. Strictly correlate JSON-RPC version and request ID,
  require one unambiguous result or error, keep remote response details out of
  transport diagnostics, and preserve an explicit null result for void server
  methods.

- Complete WAB faucet funding through one exact wallet-owned BRC-29 output.
  Fee-adjusted output amounts are bounded without weakening exact script
  binding, real Wallet Toolbox symbol metadata remains accessor-safe, and the
  redemption is staged and labeled before broadcast. Interrupted retries
  recover the same transaction from its dedicated basket or recognize the
  already-internalized action instead of signing the faucet input again.

- Make ChainTracks lifecycle and event delivery fail closed. Startup errors are
  awaited and retryable, failed or cold instances can be fully destroyed,
  long-running source promises are drained, subscriptions are bounded and
  deleted rather than tombstoned, and every listener receives an isolated
  header snapshot. Provider heights, bulk results, type guards, direct source
  options, and diagnostics are now bounded and accessor-safe. WhatsOnChain
  options and shared chain-info results cannot be mutated after validation.
  Filesystem cache mutation is serialized per digest across processes, caller
  metadata/bytes are snapshotted before awaits, and bulk revalidation takes the
  writer lock. Bulk-file reconciliation and multi-record replacement are atomic
  in Knex and IndexedDB, ordinary mutations reach durable storage before memory,
  failed writes restore the prior manager state, and remote manifests cannot
  supply local storage identities. Custom storage implementations must add the
  optional atomic replacement method before performing multi-file changes.
  Remote clients require complete live metadata and bounded event topology,
  subscription state, timers, and single-line diagnostics. Destructive Knex
  rollback failures now propagate. The wallet monitor independently binds its
  event source to the configured network, authenticates and copies every
  reorganization header, bounds and deduplicates deactivation retries,
  coalesces prepared-proof invalidation, cleans up partial subscriptions, and
  contains application callback failures without implicit console output.

- Make Arcade transaction-status SSE a bounded, ordered durable stream. Client
  options are snapshotted without accessors; credentials, cursors, payloads,
  fields, queued count, and queued bytes have explicit ceilings; and event data
  is validated and copied. Only one event reaches storage at a time, its cursor
  advances only after processing and persistence succeed, and a malformed,
  excessive, or failed event closes the stream without dispatching later queued
  events. Logging is silent by default and transport errors never forward the
  credential-bearing EventSource object. Monitor task setup retains one pending
  event, retries storage/checkpoint failures, and closes on removal or teardown.

- Repair monitor and daemon lifecycle ordering. Every scheduled or standalone
  run now awaits retryable ChainTracks subscriptions, standalone runs initialize
  every task, transient setup failures retry, and loop failures reset running
  state. The daemon starts subscriptions before ChainTracks and tasks, can stop
  after a successful start, and destroys monitor resources before storage even
  when cleanup fails. Monitor event/task names and diagnostic text are bounded;
  library logging is opt-in and dotenv loading is quiet.

- Authenticate every ordinary Merkle-proof result before it can create a
  `ProvenTx` or restore a failed transaction. Provider responses are copied and
  structurally bounded, must contain a leaf matching the requested txid
  (independently of the optional `txid` marker),
  must compute the canonical header root at the same height, and must resolve
  through a proof-of-work-valid wallet header. Monitor consumers additionally
  require the local ChainTracks root verdict and bind the request's raw
  transaction to its txid. WhatsOnChain, Bitails, and Arcade enforce the same
  invariant when called directly; TSC conversion rejects malformed, sparse,
  oversized, and unsafe-integer proofs. `TaskUnFail` uses a one-shot internal
  authorization guard and re-reads its first mutating page so batches over 100
  cannot be skipped. Existing wire formats and public method signatures remain
  compatible; the optional root-validator argument is additive.

- Authenticate external transaction-status results before they can influence
  wallet state. Results must be uniquely bound to requested txids and have
  consistent mined/known/unknown depth, terminal, and input-conflict fields;
  provider attribution is local, while descriptions and competing txids are
  copied and bounded. Malformed providers fail over instead of supplying
  failure, quarantine, abort-protection, or double-spend evidence. Arcade also
  validates and binds its complete transaction-data response before status
  classification or proof parsing, and WhatsOnChain rejects impossible depth.
  Monitor proof, no-send, and abandonment scans now preserve stable pagination
  while rows leave their query, and a rejected proof counts as one attempt.

- Bound raw-transaction and proof-provider envelopes before inspection.
  Raw results are txid-bound, accessor-free owned byte arrays capped at 32 MiB;
  malformed providers fail over and cannot forge local attribution or mutate
  accepted bytes. Merkle provider notes are copied as bounded scalar data and
  legacy custom services may supply at most eight dense proof candidates.
  Monitor options, task work controls, persisted checkpoints, and polled block
  headers are also validated and copied before they control background work.

- Contain UTXO-oracle evidence and invalid-change review work. Provider results
  are accessor-free, bounded, outpoint-consistent owned data with locally
  configured attribution; malformed responses fail over and never become spent
  evidence. Manual and admin review require canonical identities and exact
  modes, booleans, pages, offsets, tags, and safe monetary totals. Whole-wallet
  compatibility scans have a 10,000-candidate ceiling, and a release rebinds the
  exact classified outpoint, value, basket, ownership, and allocation state
  under the write lock before changing spendability.

- Authenticate and bound script-history and transaction-broadcast provider
  boundaries. History is hash/endian-bound, accessor-free, deduplicated, and
  capped; all WhatsOnChain calls carry validated whole-request deadlines and
  chain responses are copied before use. BEEF and direct raw submissions are
  size- and txid-bound, providers receive isolated snapshots, result identities
  and state invariants are enforced with local attribution, and sensitive or
  excessive diagnostics are discarded. Malformed, throwing, or hung providers
  fail over without forging the wallet's internal timeout marker. A broadcast
  double-spend claim is terminal only after at least one exact input is
  conclusively observed spent; unknown oracle evidence remains retryable.

- Enforce one atomic `sendWith` resource invariant from SDK validation and
  binary decoding through storage, action-batch commit, provider submission,
  and delayed monitor retry. Broadcast sets contain at most 1,000 unique,
  canonical transaction IDs, including the newly created or signed
  transaction. Malformed storage flags cannot diverge from the actual list,
  and an oversized legacy batch is reported and skipped as a whole rather than
  partially broadcast or expanded without bound. If any member cannot be
  resolved or assembled, no ready subset is scheduled or broadcast; members
  already known by the network remain compatible with retrying the rest.

- Make user provisioning and schema lifecycle failure-atomic. A newly inserted
  user and its mandatory managed-change basket now share one transaction, and
  creation-race retry restarts the whole transaction. Knex migration and
  destructive rollback errors propagate, explicit empty-schema state is the
  only rollback terminator, and SQLite foreign-key enforcement is restored in
  `finally` after both successful and failed migration work.

- Keep secrets and untrusted wallet material out of implicit process logs.
  `Setup.makeEnv()` returns generated development keys without printing them;
  invalid BEEF, identity/certificate parsing, permission batching, provisioning
  races, migration failures, and IndexedDB orphan handling no longer emit raw
  objects, transaction/proof data, database details, or row identifiers. The
  existing explicit wallet logger receives only a generic BEEF-validation
  message when a caller opts into it.

- Preserve wallet write atomicity across metadata revival, entity insertion,
  and abort-time chain checks. Soft-deleted baskets, labels, label mappings,
  output tags, and tag mappings now revive in the caller's exact transaction;
  new proof-request and sync-state entities retain that transaction as well.
  `abortAction` queries external chain status before opening an IndexedDB write
  scope, then rebinds the observation to the exact transaction ID and txid
  under the write lock before committing its decision.

- Keep shared-storage schema and process lifecycle under operator authority.
  Authenticated remote migration requests are compatibility no-ops, matching
  remote destroy requests, so a wallet tenant cannot contend on global DDL or
  initialize shared storage metadata.

- Bound authenticated proof-request reads before database and memory work.
  Knex and IndexedDB apply wallet ownership in the same query/cursor scan as
  status, partial, offset, and limit filtering. Custom providers retain a
  bounded compatibility path and must supply exact txids or a provider-native
  scoped query for wallets with more than 10,000 proof requests.

- Bound caller-selected Wallet Storage RPC offsets as well as page sizes.
  Top-level list offsets, nested find paging, and synchronization checkpoints
  are rejected before database/cursor work when they exceed the selected
  resource profile. Operators can raise the explicit ceiling for larger
  histories without changing the wire format.

- Redact internal Wallet Storage failures at every authenticated HTTP response
  boundary. JSON-RPC and action-batch upload routes preserve explicit public
  wallet errors, but generic exceptions and custom `WERR_INTERNAL` diagnostics
  now return only the stable internal-error name and default message. Detailed
  provider, database, and filesystem failures remain available through
  explicitly configured operator logging and telemetry.

- Clarify local-contact authority throughout SDK and Wallet Toolbox identity
  documentation. A saved contact is an authoritative wallet-local trust anchor
  based on the user's independent validation, analogous to accepting a
  self-signed certificate. Its infinite trust is intentionally local—not a
  third-party certification or transferable trust claim—and authenticated
  contact storage proves retention of that decision rather than the underlying
  real-world identity.

- Re-bind cryptographically authenticated identity-overlay certificates to the
  exact lookup they answer before applying trust thresholds. A dishonest lookup
  host can no longer answer an identity-key or public-attribute query with a
  different valid trusted certificate. Local contacts remain authoritative;
  contact lookup matching continues to follow the caller-installed source's
  explicit local trust contract.

- Harden local ChainTracks persistence and legacy bulk tooling. Memory-backed
  trackers no longer share state, IndexedDB and Knex require unique active
  headers and consecutive parent linkage, reorganization walks are bounded and
  fail atomically, direct admissions are authenticated, and Knex serializes tip
  mutation through an internal state row. MySQL now stores 64-character hex
  values as `VARCHAR(64)` and multi-megabyte header objects as `LONGBLOB`; the
  additive migration clears the rebuildable legacy live-header cache before
  widening fields that permissive MySQL could already have truncated. Bulk
  manifests, local readers, exporters, filesystem operations, and lock queues
  now have canonical path, byte, count, continuity, genesis, digest,
  proof-of-work, and progress bounds. Filesystem cache reads are bounded before
  allocation and authenticate writes, while the durable download budget now
  serializes reservations across processes and fails closed on an abandoned
  lock instead of silently resetting or losing allowance.

- Fix the legacy `BHServiceClient` Merkle-root cache so rejected, stale, or
  externally written roots can never become authoritative. Every verdict now
  resolves a bounded canonical header, validates its computed hash and proof
  of work, and binds it to the requested height or hash. Its HTTP reads reject
  redirects and malformed endpoints, retain whole-body deadlines, and enforce
  response and batch ceilings. ChainTracks core options are validated before
  startup, and all library/factory logging is now silent unless the embedding
  application supplies the existing optional logger.

- Treat every remote ChainTracks HTTP/SSE and WhatsOnChain HTTP/CDN/WebSocket
  response as untrusted input: retain the
  deadline through bounded body consumption, bound and idle-timeout streams,
  prohibit redirects and ambiguous endpoint URLs, validate canonical header
  bytes and proof of work, and bind network, height, hash, and reorganization
  results to each request before returning or queueing them. Submitted and live
  header queues are copy-isolated, deduplicated where applicable, and bounded.
  Service-discovered CDN links must remain credential-free public HTTPS with
  DNS-pinned Node connections, legacy history streams are range-ordered and
  chunked, and no declared target contributes to bulk chain selection before
  its complete header and proof of work have been authenticated.

- Authenticate every discovered permission token against its exact BEEF
  outpoint, canonical signed PushDrop fields, locally derived locking key, and
  signed grant content. Basket membership and tags remain selectors only. Bind
  public partial actions and all token mint, renewal, coalescing, and revocation
  flows to the exact authorized final transaction and actual input indexes.
  Include signer-authenticated storage service charges in the exact spend sent
  for permission approval, without changing the BRC-100 API or wire format, and
  fail closed on inconsistent sources or unsafe monetary arithmetic. The exact
  packed platform measurements are 2,184,519 / 520,753 / 397,289 bytes for Vite
  and 1,704,383 / 471,571 / 370,439 for esbuild (raw/gzip/Brotli), with reviewed
  ceilings of 2,230,000 / 535,000 / 410,000 and
  1,740,000 / 485,000 / 380,000 respectively. Mobile measures
  2,344,815 / 597,625 / 454,020 for Metro and
  4,579,110 / 1,919,816 / 1,489,229 for optimized Hermes bytecode, with reviewed
  ceilings of 2,400,000 / 610,000 / 465,000 and
  4,675,000 / 1,960,000 / 1,520,000 respectively.

- Bind UMP renewal to an exact canonical, field-signed predecessor owned by the
  local wallet and require one exact replacement token in the completed action.
  Bind WAB faucet funding to its exact Atomic BEEF target, output-zero R-puzzle
  commitment, actual wallet input index, and returned final transaction ID.

- Bind legacy P2PKH funding imports to the exact atomic signing target and
  final wallet transaction. Reject result-only transaction IDs, ambiguous
  outpoints, oversized or redirected provider responses, and unbounded BEEF
  recursion/source graphs before signing or allocation.

- Atomically consume BRC-103 signed-message nonces across StorageServer replicas.
  The additive `2026-09-16-001 add auth message replay claims` migration creates
  `auth_message_nonces` with a composite session-or-identity scope/nonce
  uniqueness constraint and expiry index. Signed follow-up and unsigned
  initial-request replays are both rejected. Run the migration before deploying
  the new runtime; otherwise authentication processing fails closed.

- Integrate upstream security corrections without dropping the sync recovery contracts.
  Record combined browser/mobile artifact costs and limits in the sync transfer guide.

- Validate replacement proofs across providers before reconciling stale RPC sync metadata; preserve raw transactions and checkpoints on failure.

- Start sync copies conservatively and adapt page work after committed responses.
  Validate at most eight remote proofs concurrently, draining failure work before
  rejecting the page. Preserve all proof and checkpoint checks. Record-transfer
  candidates now use 2.13.0 to distinguish them from published 2.12.0.

- Require an affirmative certifier-signature verification result before
  storing directly acquired or issuer-returned certificates. Identity overlay
  results are verified before decryption and trust scoring, so forged
  certificates cannot become wallet-held or trusted discovered identities. The
  synchronized browser Vite ceilings advance to 1,695,000 raw and 401,000 gzip,
  covering measured 1,694,211-byte and 400,048-byte bundles; Brotli is unchanged.
  The mobile Metro raw ceiling advances to 1,750,000 for the measured
  1,748,892-byte bundle. The browser esbuild raw ceiling advances to 1,323,000
  for the measured 1,321,768-byte bundle, its gzip ceiling advances to 365,000
  for the measured 364,413-byte bundle, and the optimized Hermes gzip ceiling
  advances to 1,442,000 for the measured 1,441,531-byte bytecode; remaining
  compressed ceilings are unchanged.
- Never cache, coalesce, or reuse spending approvals, give each prompt a
  distinct request identity, and paginate the complete action history before
  calculating an authorization token's prior spending.
- Require HTTPS for credential-bearing remote storage and Arcade SSE outside
  explicit loopback development, disable dependency debug output, and avoid
  serializing credential-bearing transport errors. Snapshot formats remain
  unchanged and are documented as wallet-equivalent secrets.
- Make new WAB account creation resumable when wallet setup, funding, KDF, UMP
  publication, or the final acknowledgement is interrupted. The manager accepts
  a clean missing-token result only for a server-declared pending registration,
  finalizes after successful publication, repairs a lost acknowledgement on the
  next login, and preserves fail-closed continuity for active and legacy WABs.
- Add optional bounded sync transfers for oversized records, authenticated pieces,
  durable Knex staging, full-frame SHA-256 verification, and stale-checkpoint
  rejection before merging. Add the two staging tables through migration
  `2026-09-09-001`; reverse only that migration before restarting older code. Frames are limited
  to 64 MiB and ordinary pages keep their existing transport. See
  [the transport and migration guide](./docs/sync-transfer.md).

- Upgrade IndexedDB to schema version 6 with a non-unique transaction-ID/user
  index. Use existing reference, reclaim, commission, and relation keys for
  sync lookups, avoiding repeated scans as a local wallet grows. Preserve
  user filtering, pagination, existing bytes, and duplicate transaction IDs.
  Proof-batch preflight checks resolve only requested transaction IDs through
  the existing index, preserving proof validation and primary-key ordering.
  Older clients requesting schema version 5 cannot open the upgraded database.

- Add negotiated compact sync checkpoints, reusing committed page progress while
  retaining complete writer-side ID mappings and the legacy provider fallback.
  Avoid per-scalar reviver callbacks when decoding binary JSON pages without
  changing marker escaping or byte semantics. Use the already negotiated binary
  codec for large schema-defined sync response byte arrays, reducing wire and
  authentication payload size while preserving legacy arrays and unrelated data.
  Retain authenticated full-copy,
  resume, malformed-input, and transport CPU/payload regression coverage.
  Local packed measurements are 1,701,711 raw / 401,038 gzip / 314,272 Brotli
  bytes (Vite), 1,327,368 / 364,550 / 293,224 (esbuild),
  1,753,648 / 445,136 / 345,369 (Metro), and
  3,557,663 / 1,426,740 / 1,121,821 (Hermes). The raw ceilings become
  1,702,000, 1,327,500, 1,755,000, and 3,558,500 respectively.
  Vite and esbuild gzip ceilings increase to 402,000 and 366,000 bytes.
  Hosted Linux measures 365,818 esbuild gzip bytes and 1,445,624 Hermes gzip
  bytes; the Hermes gzip ceiling becomes 1,446,500.
  The esbuild Brotli ceiling is 293,750 bytes. Asynchronous platform hashing
  for large SDK signature payloads brings the Vite Brotli ceiling to 314,500
  bytes, the Hermes raw ceiling to 3,560,000 bytes, and its Brotli ceiling to
  1,125,000 bytes (measured 1,124,446); other compressed ceilings remain unchanged.
  The added portable sync/progress and decoding paths account for
  the increase; no Node-only backend is introduced into portable bundles.

- Keep Argon2id-backed UMP v3 wallets available in React Native and other
  runtimes without WebAssembly by falling back to an asynchronously yielding,
  standards-compatible JavaScript implementation. The same KDF parameters and
  derived bytes are preserved, so existing tokens require no migration and
  WebAssembly-capable runtimes retain the faster path. The existing public
  `hash-wasm`-compatible utility contract remains intact: secret-bearing,
  non-binary-output, and non-byte-array requests stay on `hash-wasm` and are
  never reinterpreted by a host backend or fallback. Native registration is
  available from both mobile and client roots, concurrent cold callers share
  one preload attempt, and both alternative implementations validate result
  type and length. Unrelated validation errors propagate even without the
  WebAssembly global. The current-main macOS
  reference fixtures measure 1,690,925 raw / 398,461 gzip / 311,955 Brotli
  bytes with Vite, 1,319,059 raw / 362,220 gzip / 291,206 Brotli bytes with
  esbuild, 1,746,067 raw / 442,648 gzip / 343,342 Brotli bytes with Metro, and
  3,542,034 raw / 1,419,515 gzip / 1,117,531 Brotli bytes as optimized Hermes
  bytecode; hosted Linux measures 1,439,166 gzip bytes. Combined with the
  interrupted-registration recovery path above, current measurements are
  1,694,823 raw / 399,940 gzip / 312,528 Brotli bytes with Vite, 1,322,223 raw
  / 364,260 gzip / 291,914 Brotli bytes with esbuild, 1,749,694 raw / 443,665
  gzip / 344,059 Brotli bytes with Metro, and 3,549,495 raw / 1,441,622 gzip /
  1,119,600 Brotli bytes as optimized Hermes bytecode. The reviewed ceilings
  advance to 1,697,000 raw / 400,000 gzip Vite bytes, 1,324,000 raw / 365,000
  gzip esbuild bytes, 1,752,000 raw Metro bytes, and 3,552,000 raw / 1,442,000
  gzip Hermes bytes; Brotli ceilings remain unchanged.

- Extend the BRC-98/99/111 permission-module interface with an optional semantic
  `handleRequest` hook. A module can now return a conforming BRC-100 result
  directly or invoke the underlying wallet operation at most once, while
  existing `onRequest`/`onResponse` transformation modules remain compatible.
  The companion `@bsv/ecpm-permission-module` uses this hook to implement
  `p ecpm` point multiplication without adding a BRC-100 method or wire call.

- Add opt-in prepared BEEF storage for Knex-backed normal `createAction`
  funding. COOK (Create Once, Output Kept) stores a user-scoped, exact,
  independently verified and checksummed proof closure, merges valid hits
  without invoking the canonical builder, and treats every miss or cache
  failure as the existing canonical path. Missing roots and newly finalized
  managed-change transactions are queued only after foreground action work is
  complete; bounded writes, reads, and gradual backfill are separately
  controlled and default off. Reorganizations stale derived artifacts, a
  database proof epoch fences in-flight cross-process writes, purge removes
  unused rows, and prepared data remains outside wallet sync. The
  Knex worker is excluded from portable bundles. Reviewed Vite ceilings advance
  to 1,610,250 raw / 379,750 gzip / 298,000 Brotli bytes and esbuild ceilings
  to 1,255,000 raw / 346,250 gzip / 278,000 Brotli, covering local measurements
  of 1,609,783 / 379,492 / 297,253 and 1,254,603 / 344,792 / 277,384 bytes;
  hosted Linux Vite Brotli and esbuild gzip measured 297,585 and 345,711 bytes.
  The Hermes raw / gzip ceilings advance to 3,374,500 / 1,369,000 bytes,
  covering local measurements of 3,372,554 / 1,348,354 and hosted Linux
  measurements of 3,373,560 / 1,368,128 bytes; Metro and Hermes Brotli
  ceilings remain unchanged.
- Add the built-in BRC-177 `p nosend expiry` module for seconds, Unix timestamp,
  and block-height deadlines. Protected actions are prefunded through an
  accepted transaction, contain no wallet change, and retain a pre-signed
  reclaim across restarts, synchronized storage, devices, and keyless remote
  monitors. Atomic lifecycle transitions, active-storage ownership,
  fail-closed status checks, backoff-controlled recovery of terminally rejected
  reclaims, quarantined race outputs, and locally validated proof finality
  prevent duplicate reclaim activation and unsafe state regression. Wallet
  Permissions Manager authorizes module use and spending
  before prefunding, attributes the funding fee to the requesting originator,
  and rechecks the current monthly ledger before releasing the protected
  action. Existing actions and ordinary `noSend` calls are unchanged. The
  current-main macOS reference fixtures measure 1,662,220 raw / 388,763 gzip /
  305,307 Brotli bytes with Vite, 1,297,621 raw / 355,579 gzip / 285,031 Brotli
  bytes with esbuild, 1,710,494 raw / 430,613 gzip / 334,490 Brotli bytes with
  Metro, and 3,474,604 raw / 1,406,878 gzip / 1,090,948 Brotli bytes as
  optimized Hermes bytecode. The reviewed ceilings advance to 1,665,000 /
  390,000 / 307,000 Vite bytes, 1,300,000 / 357,000 / 287,000 esbuild bytes,
  1,712,000 / 455,000 / 360,000 Metro bytes, and 3,480,000 / 1,410,000 /
  1,095,000 Hermes bytes.

- Report `listOutputs` `totalOutputs` as the size of the whole result set on
  every page, in both the IndexedDB and Knex storage providers. A short final
  page previously returned only that page's length, so a client paging a large
  basket saw the total collapse to the size of the last page; an offset at or
  past the end now counts instead of inferring, and the managed-change spec-op
  no longer discards the total it already computed. Full pages, first pages,
  and empty result sets are unchanged, so no consumer migration is required.
  `balanceAndUtxos` now terminates from page progress instead of relying on the
  former collapsing total, preventing a zero-progress loop after the final page.
  The reviewed Vite raw-size ceiling advances by 500 bytes to 1,607,500,
  covering the hosted Linux measurement of 1,607,015 bytes; the Vite compressed
  and esbuild ceilings remain unchanged.

- Serialize typed AtomicBEEF and competing BEEF in wallet review errors as
  portable JSON arrays, keeping HTTP and relay error recovery compatible with
  both historical array wallets and current binary Wallet Wire wallets.
- Serialize real typed arrays portably in outbound WAB requests while
  preserving arbitrary inbound WAB JSON objects exactly.

- Accept legacy BRC-95 payment envelopes that include unrelated BEEF branches
  by reducing them to the declared transaction and its dependency closure
  before strict proof and BRC-29 validation. Malformed transactions, invalid
  proofs, and incorrectly locked payment outputs remain rejected. The shared
  helper adds 137 bytes to the local optimized Hermes fixture. The reviewed
  ceilings advance by 1,000 bytes to 3,361,000 raw and 1,362,000 gzip, covering
  the measured macOS raw size of 3,360,137 bytes and hosted Linux gzip size of
  1,361,509 bytes; the Brotli ceiling remains unchanged.

- Commit each received wallet-storage sync page and its durable checkpoint in
  one provider transaction. Large IndexedDB replications avoid thousands of
  transaction startup/commit cycles, failed pages roll back without advancing
  the checkpoint, and abort cleanup preserves the original storage error.

- Fill wallet-storage sync pages with adaptive, size-aware source queries and
  add composite SQL indexes for user-scoped proof lookups. Sync clients may
  request optional source record totals for exact progress and ETA displays;
  older clients and providers remain wire-compatible and do not incur count
  queries unless totals are requested. Remote clients also recover from a
  provider's HTTP 413 response ceiling by retrying the read-only sync request
  with a smaller chunk budget and reusing the working limit for later pages.
  Runtime validation rejects malformed remote totals, and MySQL rollback
  restores the foreign-key support index before removing the new composites.
  The retained authenticated candidate-provider benchmark fills a 250-record
  proof page with three source reads (`10, 80, 160`) on SQLite and MySQL.
  Clean macOS fixtures measure Vite at 1,609,916 raw, 379,552 gzip, and 297,188
  Brotli bytes; esbuild at 1,254,827 raw, 344,883 gzip, and 277,729 Brotli
  bytes; Metro at 1,662,714 raw, 419,740 gzip, and 326,785 Brotli bytes; and
  Hermes at 3,371,236 raw, 1,347,950 gzip, and 1,061,946 Brotli bytes. The
  reviewed ceilings advance to 1,611,000/380,000/297,500 for Vite,
  1,256,000/346,000/278,200 for esbuild, and 3,373,000/1,368,000 raw/gzip for
  Hermes. Metro and the Hermes Brotli ceiling remain unchanged.

- Make verified phone changes interruption-safe by staging the replacement key
  in WAB, publishing the UMP rotation, and then finalizing WAB. Authentication
  can recover an interrupted transition from the current or pending key and
  idempotently finish it without creating a second UMP update.

- Prune `inputBEEF` to the dependency closure of explicitly declared action
  inputs before remote request serialization and repeat the pruning on the
  server before verification and persistence. Unrelated proof branches no
  longer consume transfer or validation work or cause an otherwise valid
  action to fail; proof data required by a declared input is still fully
  validated.

- Add a local-first ChainTracks control plane for browser, mobile, and Node
  wallets, including explicit local-primary/remote-only mode, independently
  sourced consistency checks, quorum-backed exceptional fallback, local-clear
  hooks, and opt-in divergence recovery. Add a portable packaged-checkpoint
  cache contract and a Node filesystem implementation with validated reads and
  atomic writes. Coalesce concurrent immutable-file misses, centralize bounded
  fetch retries, enforce whole-response deadlines and byte ceilings, and expose
  cache/download counters and an optional upstream-byte budget. Bulk and live
  ingestion now enforce each header's declared proof-of-work target, and local
  consistency checks detect both quorum-confirmed divergence and a
  quorum-confirmed stuck height before optional recovery. The reviewed platform
  service seam also accepts a composed SDK `chainTracker` directly while
  retaining the existing client-wrapping default. The reviewed platform
  ceilings advance to 1,601,000 Vite bytes, 1,249,000 esbuild bytes, and
  3,358,000 Hermes bytes; their matching gzip/Brotli ceilings are
  377,000/296,000, 344,000/276,000, and 1,360,000/1,070,000 bytes.
- Keep ChainTracks availability independent of immutable-header verification:
  stale heights now return immediately behind a single refresh, complete
  digest/linkage/chain-work/proof-of-work validation can run in a bounded Node
  worker pool, and historical reads release the manager lock before disk,
  network, or worker waits. Filesystem caches use content-addressed objects,
  quarantine rejected entries, and promote validated legacy files without
  deleting the only retained copy. A crash-safe download ledger reserves every
  physical retry before network I/O and survives restarts; failed objects back
  off before another attempt. The reference server keeps probes local, applies
  separate historical concurrency admission, and publishes complete CDN
  generations behind an atomic pointer while retaining rollback generations.
- Age proactive pending-transaction review from immutable request creation
  time, so repeated proof polling cannot keep a rejected transaction below the
  reconciliation threshold forever. A descendant of a locally terminal parent
  now fails from that durable storage evidence; failed-parent outputs remain
  quarantined while unrelated inputs are released for reuse. The shared change
  adds about 1.1 kB to the Vite browser artifact and 3.8 kB to Hermes bytecode;
  the reviewed raw ceilings advance to 1,585,000 and 3,322,000 bytes while all
  compressed ceilings remain unchanged; the esbuild raw ceiling advances to
  1,238,000 bytes.
- Keep mainnet and testnet ChainTracks usable from browser and webview wallets:
  browser runtimes temporarily select the CORS-enabled legacy service while
  Node runtimes retain Arcade/go-chaintracks v2. `Services.getHeight` now falls
  back to WhatsOnChain if ChainTracks is unavailable and preserves the original
  ChainTracks error when both providers fail.
- Route `ttn` wallets through the isolated `teratestnet` overlay preset and
  enable the public TTN Arcade broadcaster/proof provider by default. TTN does
  not register the incompatible legacy ARC BEEF fallback. Other chain defaults
  are unchanged, and an empty Arcade URL explicitly disables Arcade.
- Reconcile Arcade broadcast outcomes as durable wallet state. Retryable
  locktime and parent conditions remain pending, while validator failures fail
  the request and explicit missing-input or conflict evidence atomically fails
  every local transaction copy and quarantines its wallet-owned inputs without
  depending on WhatsOnChain. Cached accepted/seen labels can no longer revive a
  terminal conflict; only a mined event whose Merkle proof validates through
  the configured chain tracker may repair it. Arcade also participates in the
  shared transaction-status service so double-spend review remains conservative
  on networks with no explorer. A scheduled paged pass also reconciles aged
  pending requests from durable Arcade lifecycle state, including orphan-mempool
  losers whose SSE event was missed; mined/known evidence wins over rejection.
  Inconclusive or absent UTXO providers no longer
  masquerade as a spent-output verdict in invalid-change release, stale-input
  reconciliation, proof recovery, or storage diagnostics. Invalid-change review
  returns conclusive read-only findings plus unknown diagnostics. Direct release
  blocks atomically with machine-readable `WERR_UTXO_REVIEW_INCONCLUSIVE` when
  any result is unknown. Monitor Admin uses bounded, five-second-deadline pages
  and can explicitly release the confirmed-spent subset while retaining unknowns;
  every mutation rechecks ownership/allocation under lock and records audit
  evidence. Monitor Admin scans by default and requires explicit confirmation.
  The
  Arcade SSE cursor advances only after both event storage work and cursor
  persistence succeed; either failure leaves the event queued for ordered retry.
- Replace 32-satoshi default-basket fragments with a progressive liquidity
  policy targeting 144 useful 5,000-satoshi outputs. New actions create at most
  eight outputs from real surplus and migrate at most four fee-positive legacy
  fragments, while a same-tier compatibility plan guarantees that optional
  shaping cannot refuse an action the former planner could fund. Explicitly
  funded actions materialize change from their existing surplus without
  gathering pool inputs, and SQLite policy migrations use sync-compatible UTC
  ISO timestamps.
- Prefer completed, then unproven, then sending parents. Plans above 16 inputs
  compare exact transaction-plus-BEEF bytes before accepting pending ancestry;
  pending change remains an unconditional last-resort funding source. Align
  action-batch reservation/planning and add a read-only Monitor liquidity
  report. All work limits are configurable and accept `-1` for explicit
  operator-selected unlimited behavior.
- Restore delayed broadcast for durable permission-token persistence. Permission
  grants no longer inherit network-broadcast latency; the managed-change policy
  handles queued ancestry without hiding it or preferring it over settled funds.
- Isolate each in-memory action batch by explicit staged-output or `sendWith`
  membership, so unrelated immediate actions and `noSend` roots cannot be
  captured by or commit a workspace. Add an exact-input resume protocol for
  expired leases, structured lifecycle errors, and a provider-enforced
  cumulative reservation limit that defaults to 256 outputs and can be
  configured, including `-1` for operator-selected unlimited operation.
- Keep the combined action-batch, managed-liquidity, browser-fallback, and
  fail-safe reconciliation browser/mobile cost bounded by exact packed-artifact
  contracts. Local verification measures 1,557,683 raw / 366,927 gzip / 287,337
  Brotli bytes with Vite, 1,215,983 raw / 333,466 gzip / 268,497 Brotli bytes
  with esbuild, 1,617,544 raw Metro bytes, and 3,271,146 raw / 1,302,110 gzip /
  1,025,812 Brotli Hermes bytes. Reviewed raw ceilings are 1,561,000 Vite bytes,
  1,220,000 esbuild bytes, 1,710,000 Metro bytes, and 3,275,000 Hermes bytes;
  compressed ceilings remain independently governed.
- Fix `WalletStorageManager.getStoreEndpointURL` / `getStores().endpointURL` to
  duck-type provider `endpointUrl` instead of matching
  `constructor.name === 'StorageClient'`. Production minifiers rename classes,
  so the name check left remote stores with `endpointURL: undefined` while
  sync still worked; clients that select a backup by URL (make primary) failed.
- Let Storage Server operators select an explicit listener host while retaining
  the historical omitted-host behavior for existing callers. The official
  Wallet Infrastructure image uses this to bind direct-mode traffic on IPv4
  and to keep the application listener on loopback behind nginx.
- Preserve forward-compatible Storage Server browser preflights by accepting
  additive well-formed request headers when operators have not configured a
  strict `WALLET_STORAGE_CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS` list.
- Restore completed `createAction` and `signAction` Atomic BEEF results to
  numeric arrays at the public wallet boundary so legacy BRC-100 JSON bridges
  preserve their historical wire shape. Typed byte arrays remain supported by
  `AtomicBEEF` and binary Wallet Wire transports.
- Fix credential-free Arcade/go-chaintracks bootstrap when ChainTracks bulk
  storage is empty. A first batch is now accepted only from height zero and is
  still checked for continuity, proof of work, file integrity, and the exact
  configured network genesis before it becomes available.
- Make ChainTracks credential-free by default on mainnet, testnet, and
  TerraTestNet through the public Arcade/go-chaintracks v2 HTTP and SSE APIs.
  Add explicit STN and Terra Scaling TestNet support, exact per-network genesis
  headers, isolated in-memory storage, and remove silent testnet aliases.
- Add prioritized bulk/live source failover, locally validated last-good height
  operation, source health reporting, bounded request timeouts, browser-safe SSE
  reconnection, network checks, and a globally rate-limited anonymous
  WhatsOnChain fallback for mainnet/testnet. WhatsOnChain keys remain optional
  and rejected configured keys retry header/info requests anonymously.
- Preserve the default automatically negotiated in-memory `noSend` batching and
  `sendWith` lifecycle introduced in #289. Expand inherited txid-only proof
  ancestors for cold clients, preserve caller-declared known txids, report the
  actual viable-change funding shortfall, and document aborting listed staged
  actions by transaction ID.
- Collapse fragmented `createAction` storage work into one atomic write
  transaction, batch proof retrieval and compound-proof validation, overlap
  independent proof reads with persistence, bulk-insert untagged outputs, and
  batch canonical P2PKH verification. The retained 153-input authenticated
  remote PXC workload is below 500 ms at p95.
- Reuse parsed root and counterparty keys and one BRC-42 shared secret per
  counterparty while signing managed BRC-29 inputs, keep funding selection and
  transaction-size accounting linear, and avoid redundant BEEF validation,
  unused process reads, and unconditional commission reads on the successful
  path. Generated scripts, signatures, fees, input ordering, BEEF bytes, and
  error diagnostics remain equivalence-tested.
- Add bounded-cardinality spans for proof decode/merge, persistence, signing,
  verification, result assembly, serialization, and server-side processing.
  No telemetry header or protocol field is added; BRC-103/104, AuthFetch, Auth
  Express Middleware, AuthSocket, JSON-RPC, and wallet wire behavior are unchanged.
- Coalesce only recent timestamp-only touches for already-authenticated shared
  Knex sessions, while immediately persisting every authentication and
  certificate transition. This removes a synchronous replicated PXC write from
  the normal RPC path; exact per-request persistence remains available with
  `touchIntervalMs: 0`.
- Make expired action-batch reservations non-blocking in indexed queries and
  repair MySQL rollback support indexes. Existing databases migrate through the
  normal Knex path, and full PXC down-to-empty/re-upgrade is regression-tested.
- Make UMP account lookup resilient to stale SLAP advertisements and partial
  overlay failure. One verified matching token establishes an existing account;
  otherwise one clean empty response establishes a new account. Malformed,
  rejected, empty, and unavailable peers cannot veto a verified token, and
  malformed or unavailable peers cannot veto a clean empty response. Lookups
  with no usable response remain errors; WAB existing-account continuity still
  prevents replacement-wallet onboarding.
- Resolve competing verified UMP tokens on on-chain proof. A candidate spent
  anywhere in another candidate's BEEF ancestry is superseded (evidence merged
  across hosts serving different depths; ancestry walked iteratively so deep
  update chains cannot exhaust the stack). Forked candidates resolve only when
  exactly one provably consumed a same-identity predecessor token, which
  requires the account's keys; anything less decisive stays an error so a
  wrong token can never be chosen silently. Resolved conflicts report a
  `supersededTokens` count in lookup telemetry.
- Plan legacy `createAction` funding against the exact unreserved managed-change
  set before persistence, claim the selected inputs atomically in one storage
  transaction, and fail economically impossible fragmented wallets before
  inserting a transaction row. Add targeted Knex and IndexedDB indexes and
  remove IndexedDB's per-output transaction-status lookup.
- Avoid building full known-txid indexes on the common single-proof path and
  report privacy-safe createAction candidate, funding, proof-fetch, BEEF merge,
  trim, serialization, and known-history timings. BRC-103/104, AuthFetch, Auth
  Express Middleware, AuthSocket, JSON-RPC, and wallet wire behavior are unchanged.
- Keep remote-storage trace correlation inside the telemetry sink instead of
  adding unsupported headers to AuthFetch requests. BRC-103/104, AuthFetch,
  Auth Express Middleware, AuthSocket, JSON-RPC, and storage wire behavior are
  unchanged.
- Point Wallet Toolbox contributors and AI agents to the canonical stack-level
  contribution and quality policy; keep client and mobile candidate versions
  in release lockstep without changing runtime behavior.
- Harden storage, action-batch, remoting, WAB, authentication, chaintracker,
  and monitor implementation paths while preserving persisted schemas,
  positional call compatibility, and public wallet/storage contracts.
- Refresh compatible rate-limit, MySQL, and React Native build dependencies;
  consolidate entropy, Merkle-path, and action-batch iteration without
  changing persisted data, generated paths, or public wallet contracts.
- Remove generated SQLite test databases before and after every Jest run so
  repeated local validation cannot silently consume unbounded disk space.
- Ship the Express declaration dependency required by the public storage
  server, edge-policy, and rate-limit declarations. Validate authenticated
  storage identities explicitly and normalize multi-value Express 5 headers
  instead of relying on implicit request augmentation or scalar headers.
- Add capability-negotiated action-batch manifest format 2 without changing
  BRC-100. It derives source/output scripts from the authenticated transaction
  graph, retains only the external proof frontier, bulk-loads shared storage
  rows, and commits an already prepared manifest by semantic digest. Version-1
  providers and clients retain their existing behavior.
- Add authenticated `ABP1` multi-blob uploads with bounded gzip/Brotli/identity
  negotiation, decompression limits, prepared-manifest authorization, per-item
  content verification, bounded concurrency, and one-transaction bulk storage.
  The physical request limit chunks unbounded logical transactions; it is not
  a script or consensus limit.
- Add optional script-verifier injection to Wallet, setup helpers, and local
  storage providers. Internal checks use explicit consensus context, distinguish
  resource exhaustion from invalid scripts, and continue verifying resolvable
  inputs when another source transaction is intentionally omitted.
- Retain typed bytes through action-batch planning, hashing, validation, and
  chunk assembly; preload external inputs and shared metadata once per atomic
  manifest; and convert Atomic BEEF only at the historical public `number[]`
  boundary without changing BRC-100 or storage protocol contracts.
- Make StorageServer, AdminServer, and the reusable ChaintracksService
  credential-free public-CORS compatible by default, with opt-in exact origin
  lists and configurable CSP/browser response headers. Add bounded parsers,
  in-flight work and Node connection limits, stable non-sensitive errors, and
  metadata-only request logging. Storage RPC work remains protected by
  BRC-103 identity, per-IP/per-identity limits, method allowlisting, and
  optional payment policy.
- Bound StorageServer work per source IP before BRC-103 authentication and per
  identity before payment/RPC handling. Both stages support shared stores, and
  proxy trust now requires an explicit hop/subnet/predicate configuration.
- Harden CWI/WAB account continuity so overlay failures, malformed or ambiguous
  UMP results, and snapshot-load failures cannot silently enter new-user
  onboarding. Add an expiring WAB auth session, legacy-compatible WAB account
  status inference, canonical E.164 phone identity, bounded KDF/snapshot
  parsing, and fail-closed UMP renewal/broadcast behavior.
- Replace WAB's endpoint-by-endpoint raw `fetch` calls with one typed transport
  enforcing HTTPS (localhost excepted), timeouts, request/response limits,
  redirect and ambient-credential protection, correlation IDs, and privacy-safe errors.
  Wallet authentication, UMP, WAB, and snapshot events now support the SDK's
  opt-in generic telemetry sink without reporting keys, snapshots, payloads,
  OTPs, or Shamir shares.
- Add automatically negotiated, in-memory planning for dependent `noSend` workloads. Capable
  storage providers reserve funding once, perform middle action planning and signing without
  persistence round trips, and atomically commit the complete workspace on `sendWith`. Existing
  BRC-100 arguments and results are unchanged, and providers without `actionBatch: 1` retain the
  legacy path. SQLite, MySQL/Knex, IndexedDB, authenticated remote clients, browser, and mobile
  builds share the same capability contract.
- Add leased per-output batch reservations, expiry cleanup, adaptive pool extension, idempotent
  manifest commits, inline content-addressed blobs up to 4 MiB, and authenticated binary uploads
  in provider-sized chunks with four-way bounded concurrency for larger batches. Broadcast remains
  outside the atomic persistence transaction.
- Make batch funding converge on fragmented wallets at production fee rates. Reservation targets
  include the fee and viable-change overhead of an added input, reactive extensions request only
  the remaining shortfall, and EWMA runway extensions subtract unconsumed reserved funding without
  compounding after empty or partial responses. The regression runs 16 independent actions through
  both the in-process and authenticated remote-storage paths and commits the complete batch.
- Bind remote batch authorization exclusively to the BRC-103 authenticated identity and its active
  storage provider, ignoring caller-supplied user IDs and active-state claims. Restrict JSON-RPC
  dispatch to the public remote-storage protocol so authenticated callers cannot invoke low-level
  provider methods, and rate-limit authenticated RPCs per identity key without limiting workspace
  length. Unauthenticated and cross-user batch-management regressions cover the boundary.
- Replace the cumulative 64-output reservation ceiling with repeatable extensions bounded to 64
  outputs per storage call. Workspaces and spend chains no longer have an action-count or confirmed
  funding-input ceiling; an 80-action independent batch crosses the old boundary and commits.
- Add a retained workload benchmark covering 1, 10, 50, and 250 actions across dependent,
  independent, mixed-input, and two-step signing models, four script sizes, and 25/100/250 ms
  storage latency. Run it with `pnpm --filter @bsv/wallet-toolbox bench:action-batch`.
- Release prep for `2.4.2`: transaction-pipeline, BEEF fetching, and binary transport
  performance improvements described below, published in lockstep for Node, browser, and mobile.
- Transaction pipeline performance: reuse parsed BEEF through `createAction`/`signAction`, retain
  typed bytes internally until persistence compatibility boundaries, and avoid reparsing Atomic
  BEEF during internalization and broadcast preparation.
- Fetch independent BEEF ancestor frontiers and allocated-change proofs with bounded concurrency,
  deterministic merge order, Set-based deduplication, and configurable `maxConcurrency`.
- Negotiate compact base64 JSON-RPC binary values across Node, browser, and mobile clients while
  preserving numeric-array requests and responses for old servers and clients. A 1 MiB payload is
  62.7% smaller on the wire than legacy byte-array JSON.
- Treat non-finite ancestor-fetch concurrency values as the safe default instead of silently
  returning incomplete BEEF, reject malformed binary JSON base64, and decode deeply nested JSON
  iteratively so hostile input cannot overflow the JavaScript call stack.
- Keep binary JSON-RPC requests in the legacy numeric-array format by default so rolling deployments
  cannot route a negotiated request to an older server instance. Homogeneous endpoints can opt in to
  compact requests with `StorageClientOptions.binaryRequests`; compact responses remain negotiated.

- Release prep for `2.4.2`: add a Knex-backed async BRC-103 session manager,
  the shared-session schema migration, and `StorageServer.sessionManager`
  injection so authenticated requests can move safely between replicas without
  sticky routing. Session writes reject stale cross-replica state, expire after
  a configurable TTL, and support explicit pruning. Also add an opt-out that
  skips both per-RPC logging and request-parameter serialization, and add a
  `monitor_events.created_at` index for production proof-latency correlation.
  Declare the runtime `body-parser` and `dotenv` imports explicitly;
  `auth-express-middleware@2.1.1` likewise declares its `mime-types` runtime
  import so strict package managers do not fail when loading the built packages.

- Release prep for `2.4.2`: proof completion now discovers every local
  transaction row sharing the proven txid, repairs notification-set drift from
  concurrent multi-user `internalizeAction` calls, and idempotently completes
  any local copy omitted by a last-writer-wins notification update.

- Release prep for `2.4.1`: define one managed-change policy across Knex and IndexedDB allocation,
  counting, default balance reporting, `balanceAndUtxos`, and `noSendChange`.
  Only complete BRC-29 signer metadata is eligible; custom rows remain visible
  through raw default-basket listing for recovery. `internalizeAction` now
  rejects basket insertion into `default`, prevents managed change from being
  reclassified, promotes verified legacy BRC-29 rows through `wallet payment`,
  and permits incompatible custom rows to be swept to non-default baskets
  without changing wallet balance.

- Release prep for `2.4.0`: security fix for `GHSA-36f9-7rg5-cpf8`. `buildSignableTransaction` now verifies that storage-returned outputs match the caller's requested `args.outputs` before signing (rejects substituted/altered/reclassified/missing outputs), and rejects any unrequested output that isn't client-derived change or a single commission output bounded by `MAX_STORAGE_COMMISSION_SATOSHIS`. `WalletPermissionsManager.createAction` independently verifies requested outputs are present in the signable transaction before authorizing, as defense-in-depth. Protects against a malicious or compromised `StorageClient` operator substituting or injecting outputs that would be signed and broadcast without the caller's knowledge.

- Release prep for `2.3.3`: add Arcade-first wallet service wiring, go-chaintracks
  live client/SSE support, resilient ARC/Arcade status handling, monitor
  rebroadcast safeguards, and callback-token redaction for Arcade SSE logs.

- **Public API change**: `AbortActionResult.aborted` is now typed `boolean` (was the literal `true`). The wallet returns `aborted: false` when it positively confirms the underlying transaction is already on chain (mined or known to mempool) and the abort therefore should not proceed. Callers branching on `result.aborted` should treat `false` as "refused due to on-chain confirmation" and typically follow up with `internalizeAction`. Service-unreachable conditions return `aborted: true` (with an `abortAction-offline-fallback` history note) — refusal is reserved for positive on-chain confirmation, per BRC-100.

- Fix: close the nosend orphan-output failure mode. A `nosend` transaction (created via `createAction({noSend:true})`) could be externally broadcast and confirmed on chain before any `internalizeAction` or `Monitor.TaskCheckNoSends` cycle retired its `nosend` status. Before this change, two paths could then destroy the wallet's bookkeeping for the chain-confirmed tx: `StorageProvider.abortAction` unconditionally promoted `transactions.status` to `'failed'` and `proven_tx_reqs.status` to terminal `'invalid'`, hiding every output the tx produced (including the wallet's own auto-fund change) from the `listOutputsKnex` `txStatusAllowed` filter; and `specOpNoSendActions.postProcess` (bulk-abort path) blanket-set `tx.status = 'failed'` regardless of per-row outcome. Additionally `mergedInternalize` never advanced `transactions.status` or `proven_tx_reqs.status` out of `nosend`, so even a correctly-issued post-broadcast `internalizeAction` silently no-op'd on the lifecycle. Four fixes in defense-in-depth: (1) `mergedInternalize` retires the nosend lifecycle (transition to `unproven` + req `unmined`, or all the way to `completed` if the BEEF carries a BUMP); (2) `Monitor.processNewBlockHeader` now nudges `TaskCheckNoSends.checkNow` alongside the existing `TaskCheckForProofs.checkNow` nudge, wiring up the documented-but-orphaned per-block trigger; (3) `StorageProvider.abortAction` chain-checks signed `nosend` txs via `services.getStatusForTxids` and returns `aborted: false` for `mined` or `known` (mempool-aware) txs without throwing; (4) `specOpNoSendActions.postProcess` pre-filters chain-known rows before bulk-abort and honors per-row `aborted: false` returns so race-window rows that became chain-known mid-page leave their status as `nosend` rather than being blanket-set to `failed`. Service-unreachable handling proceeds with the abort and writes an `abortAction-offline-fallback` history note for forensic audit — abort must remain possible when network confirmation is impossible. One residual edge case (backend returns success+`unknown` for a tx that is actually on chain) is documented in the PR; mitigations include the per-block `TaskCheckNoSends` nudge eventually self-healing and caller-side multi-source chain verification.

- Optimization: `TaskCheckNoSends` aging schedule on the block-triggered `checkNow` path. The unfiltered per-block scan would do an unbounded number of external `getMerklePath` lookups per block as a wallet's `nosend` set grows (escrow, un-aborted tests, abandoned batches). The new schedule keys on row age: rows fresher than 5 min are skipped entirely (protecting in-flight batched-tx workflows that chain `createAction({noSend:true, sendWith:[...]})` builds); 5 min – 1 hr rows check on every trigger; older rows progress to `~hourly` (block-height % 6), `~daily` (% 144), and `~weekly` (% 1008) cadences. Each row's modulo offset is keyed by its `provenTxReqId` so same-tier rows are staggered across the cycle (`(blockHeight + provenTxReqId) % tierInterval === 0`) rather than all firing on the same block. The scheduled daily (no-`checkNow`) cadence is unchanged and still scans every row, providing a safety net for externally-broadcast unmined `nosend` txs regardless of age.

## wallet-toolbox 2.1.27

- Add optional `contactSource` (and exported `ContactSource` / `ContactRecord` interfaces) on `WalletArgs` and the `Wallet` class. When provided, `Wallet.discoverByIdentityKey` consults the local contacts source **before** the in-process `_overlayCache` and before any network call; on a hit, the overlay is not queried at all. `Wallet.discoverByAttributes` consults the contact source's optional `findByAttributes` when present. Contact-source failures are swallowed and fall through to the existing network path so the network is never gated on a flaky contact store. A caller-installed contact source is an explicit personal trust anchor: its records are locally authoritative, not third-party certifier attestations. Synthetic contact results default to type `contact`, use empty certificate-proof fields, and receive infinite trust to express that local policy decision.
- `Wallet.discoverByIdentityKey` and `Wallet.discoverByAttributes` accept `forceRefresh?: boolean`. When `true`, both the contacts short-circuit and the 2-minute `_overlayCache` are bypassed so the network is consulted fresh — useful for a manual refresh action.
- `identityUtils.parseResults` now yields to the host runtime between certificates on UI runtimes (browser / React Native, detected at call time). On Node the yield is skipped to avoid timer overhead. Same total work; the JS thread no longer owns the frame for the duration of the loop, so menu taps and scroll keep working while a large identity result is parsed.
- `identityUtils.parseResults$` — new async-iterable form that emits each successfully parsed `VerifiableCertificate` as soon as it's ready, for callers that want progressive rendering.
- `queryOverlay` widens the per-call grace window for `ls_identity` queries to 300 ms via the new `LookupQueryOptions.graceMs`, so more in-sync identity hosts contribute outputs before the query resolves.
- `@bsv/sdk` dependency switched to the local workspace via `workspace:^2.1.1` so SDK changes flow through without an intermediate publish. Publish-time tooling rewrites `workspace:` ranges to concrete versions.

## wallet-toolbox 2.1.26

- Fix: auto-evict confirmed-stale inputs after any failed broadcast, regardless of how the broadcaster classifies the failure. When a tx is marked failed, `updateTransactionStatus(failed)` previously restored ALL consumed inputs to `spendable: true` to support transient retry. That's correct for fee/script/malformed failures where inputs are still UTXOs, but wrong for cases where the input has been spent on chain by a different tx — the wallet then picks the same already-spent UTXO on the next createAction → infinite missing-inputs broadcast loop. The new `markStaleInputsAsSpent` helper runs after `updateTransactionsStatus(failed)` and queries `services.isUtxo` per consumed input (concurrently across inputs via `Promise.all`), overriding `spendable: false` only for inputs the chain authoritatively confirms are spent. Inputs still on chain (transient/false-positive failures) keep the existing retry semantics. Service errors leave inputs untouched (eviction is opt-in based on positive evidence). Helper is broadcaster-agnostic — applies to ARC's `doubleSpend` (`SEEN_IN_ORPHAN_MEMPOOL`) and to WhatsOnChain/Bitails `invalidTx` (`missing-inputs`) classifications alike. Pre-broadcast races where concurrent createActions reach the same UTXO across separate app processes remain out of scope; that's a separate class of double-spend with its own design space (TaskReviewUtxos enqueue, locked-input semantics).

### Add `teratest` and `mock` chain types

- Change `Chain` type from `'main' | 'test'` to `'main' | 'test' | 'teratest' | 'mock'`.

**`teratest` chain:**

- Add ARC URL `https://arc-teratest.taal.com` for the teratest network.
- Chaintracks URL follows existing `${chain}net-chaintracks.babbage.systems` pattern.
- WhatsOnChain URL follows existing `https://api.whatsonchain.com/v1/bsv/${network}` pattern.
- Bitails is not available on teratest (only `main` and `test`).

**`mock` chain — full self-contained mock blockchain:**

- Add new `src/mockchain/` module with `MockServices`, `MockChainTracker`, `MockMiner`, `MockChainStorage`, and merkle tree utilities.
- `MockServices` implements the `WalletServices` interface against a local SQLite database (3 tables: `mockchain_block_headers`, `mockchain_transactions`, `mockchain_utxos`).
- Transactions are validated with full script execution via `@bsv/sdk` `Transaction.verify()`.
- Coinbase maturity rule enforced (100 block confirmations required before spending).
- On-demand block mining via `MockServices.mineBlock()`.
- Chain reorganization simulation via `MockServices.reorg()` with `txidMap` for controlling which transactions land in which new blocks.
- Add `TaskMineBlock` monitor task for periodic mining (10 minutes) with `mineNow` static flag for on-demand triggering.
- `Monitor.services` type widened from `Services` to `Services | WalletServices` to support mock chain.
- `Services` class, `createDefaultWalletServicesOptions`, and external service providers (`WhatsOnChain`, `Bitails`) throw explicit errors if instantiated with `'mock'` chain.

**Explicit chain handling across codebase:**

- Convert chain-dependent ternaries to explicit switch statements in `toWalletNetwork`, `genesisHeader`, `Bitails` constructor, WoC WebSocket ingestors, and `ChaintracksStorageNoDb`.
- Each chain value (`main`, `test`, `teratest`, `mock`) is handled explicitly rather than falling through a catch-all else branch.

Changes to improve computing balances (sum of satoshis) over various sets of wallet spendable outputs:

- Added optional ListOutputsArgs argument to Wallet balance method. This enables using the same arguments in a call to listOutputs and balance. This method injects the specOpWalletBalance string constant into the appropriate basket or tag property and returns totalOutputs as its result.
- Fully optimized specOpWalletBalance processing within listOutputsKnex to use SQL sum(satoshis). Much faster than returning arrays of outputs and summing WalletOutput results.

## wallet-toolbox v1.3.0, 2025-04-23

### Change in Handling of New Outputs NOT Assigned to a Basket

New outputs created by `createAction` / `signAction` that are NOT assigned to a basket are considered immediately SPENT.

Implications:

- Outputs transferred to a second party, either through internalizeAction or custom means, MUST NOT be assigned to a basket
  as this allows them to be spent without your wallet being notified that they are no longer spendable. This is a usage guideline, it is not enforced.
- These outputs will NOT be returned by `listOutputs`, as it only returns spendable outputs.
- These outputs WILL be returned by `listActions` with the includeOutputs option set to true.
- Your wallet will mark any output you include as inputs in your own transactions as spent at the time of transaction creation.
- If a created transaction subsequently fails to be broadcast (abandoned or invalid), the outputs are reset to spendable. This may not happen immediately.
