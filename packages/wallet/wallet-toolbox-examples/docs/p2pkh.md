# P2PKH Example: BSV Wallet Toolbox API Documentation

The documentation is split into various pages, this page covers the P2PKH script template example
of the `@bsv/wallet-toolbox-examples` package; which accompanies the `@bsv/wallet-toolbox`.

Historically, the P2PKH script template was the primary transfer pattern used for over a decade.

In particular, the sender would construct a new transaction with the payment output
and broadcast it to the network. The recipient then used network services to find
transactions that made a payment to "their" address.

There are muliple drawbacks to this legacy method of exchange:

1. The receiver is insentivized to re-use addresses to simplify lookup, destroying privacy.
2. The address must be transmitted without corruption from the receiver to the sender before starting the transfer.
3. The receiver must poll the network to discover the payment transaction.
4. The receiver typically couldn't use the new output until some number of "confirmations",
   blocks mined on top of the original transaction mining event.

A BRC-100 wallet replaces polling for transactions by payment address with SPV enabling BEEF packaging for all transactions and new outputs.

This means payments are transmitted directly to recipients as a new transaction built on inputs which can be directly validated
by the recipient against a local copy of mined block headers;
even if the chain of new transactions supporting the latest payment is arbitrarily long.

SPV enabling BEEF packaging resolves drawbacks 3 and 4 and is used in this example.
The "brc29" example extends this to demonstrate how to resolve drawbacks 1 and 2.

##### Function: inputP2PKH

Consume a P2PKH output.

To spend a P2PKH output a transaction input must be created and signed using the
associated private key.

In this example, an initial `createAction` call constructs the overall shape of a
new transaction, returning a `signableTransaction`.

The `tx` property of the `signableTransaction` should be parsed using
the standard `Beef` class. Note that it is not an ordinary AtomicBEEF for the
simple reason that the transaction has not yet been fully signed.

You can either use the method shown here to obtain a signable `Transaction` object
from this beef or you can use the `Transaction.fromAtomicBEEF` method.

To sign an input, set the corresponding input's `unlockingScriptTemplate` to an appropriately
initialized unlock object and call the `Transaction` `sign` method.

Once signed, capture the input's now valid `unlockingScript` value and convert it to a hex string.

```ts
export async function inputP2PKH(
  setup: SetupWallet,
  outputP2PKH: {
    beef: Beef
    outpoint: string
    toIdentityKey: string
    satoshis: number
  }
) {
  const o = outputP2PKH
  const env = Setup.getEnv(setup.chain)
  const privateKey: PrivateKey = PrivateKey.fromString(env.devKeys[o.toIdentityKey])
  const unlock = Setup.getUnlockP2PKH(privateKey, o.satoshis)
  const label = 'inputP2PKH'
  const car = await setup.wallet.createAction({
    inputBEEF: o.beef.toBinary(),
    inputs: [
      {
        outpoint: o.outpoint,
        unlockingScriptLength: 108,
        inputDescription: label
      }
    ],
    labels: [label],
    description: label
  })
  const st = car.signableTransaction!
  const beef = Beef.fromBinary(st.tx)
  const tx = beef.findAtomicTransaction(beef.txs.slice(-1)[0].txid)!
  tx.inputs[0].unlockingScriptTemplate = unlock
  await tx.sign()
  const unlockingScript = tx.inputs[0].unlockingScript!.toHex()
  const signArgs: SignActionArgs = {
    reference: st.reference,
    spends: { 0: { unlockingScript } },
    options: {
      acceptDelayedBroadcast: false
    }
  }
  const sar = await setup.wallet.signAction(signArgs)
  {
    const beef = Beef.fromBinary(sar.tx!)
    const txid = sar.txid!
    console.log(`
inputP2PKH to ${setup.identityKey}
input's outpoint ${o.outpoint}
satoshis ${o.satoshis}
BEEF
${beef.toHex()}
${beef.toLogString()}
`)
  }
}
```

  - An object proving the validity of the new output where the last transaction contains the new output.
- **outputP2PKH.outpoint**
  - The txid and index of the outpoint in the format `${txid}.${index}`.
- **outputP2PKH.toIdentityKey**

##### Function: outputP2PKH

Create a new P2PKH output.

Convert the destination identity key into its associated address and use that to generate a locking script.

Explicitly specify the new output to be created as part of a new action (transaction).

When outputs are explictly added to an action they must be funded:
Typically, at least one "change" input will be automatically added to fund the transaction,
and at least one output will be added to recapture excess funding.

```ts
export async function outputP2PKH(
  setup: SetupWallet,
  toIdentityKey: string,
  satoshis: number
): Promise<{
  beef: Beef
  outpoint: string
  toIdentityKey: string
  satoshis: number
}> {
  const address = PublicKey.fromString(toIdentityKey).toAddress()
  const lock = Setup.getLockP2PKH(address)
  const label = 'outputP2PKH'
  const car = await setup.wallet.createAction({
    outputs: [
      {
        lockingScript: lock.toHex(),
        satoshis,
        outputDescription: label,
        tags: ['relinquish']
      }
    ],
    options: {
      randomizeOutputs: false,
      acceptDelayedBroadcast: false
    },
    labels: [label],
    description: label
  })
  const beef = Beef.fromBinary(car.tx!)
  const outpoint = `${car.txid!}.0`
  console.log(`
outputP2PKH to ${toIdentityKey}
outpoint ${outpoint}
satoshis ${satoshis}
BEEF
${beef.toHex()}
${beef.toLogString()}
`)
  return { beef, outpoint, toIdentityKey, satoshis }
}
```

Returns

An object is returned with the following properties:

beef - object proving the validity of the new output where the last transaction contains the new output.

outpoint - The txid and index of the outpoint in the format `${txid}.${index}`.

toIdentityKey - The public key able to unlock the output.

satoshis - The amount assigned to the output.

Argument Details

- **setup**
  - The setup context which will create the new transaction containing the new P2PKH output.
- **toIdentityKey**
  - The public key which will be able to unlock the output.
    Note that the output uses the "address" associated with this public key: The HASH160 of the public key.
- **satoshis**
  - How many satoshis to transfer to this new output.

##### Function: p2pkhToAddress

```ts
export async function p2pkhToAddress()
```

##### Function: transferP2PKH

Example of moving satoshis from one wallet to another using the P2PKH template
to send directly to the "address" associated with a private key.

This example can be run by the following command:

```bash
npx tsx p2pkh
```

Combine this with the [balances](./README.md#function-balances) example to observe satoshis being transfered between
two wallets.

```ts
export async function transferP2PKH() {
  const env = Setup.getEnv('test')
  const setup1 = await Setup.createWalletClient({ env })
  const setup2 = await Setup.createWalletClient({
    env,
    rootKeyHex: env.devKeys[env.identityKey2]
  })
  const o = await outputP2PKH(setup1, setup2.identityKey, 42)
  await inputP2PKH(setup2, o)
}
```
