# Performance Benchmarks

## Transaction and BEEF pipeline (July 2026)

The transaction pipeline benchmark uses built ESM artifacts and is intentionally runnable against another build through `SDK_DIST_ROOT`. Measurements below were taken on the same Apple Silicon host with Node.js v25.9.0. Each comparison uses identical generated transactions and benchmark code.

Commands:

```bash
# 4.17 MB Atomic BEEF, 1,000-transaction spend chain
CHAIN_DEPTH=1000 SCRIPT_BYTES=4096 BENCH_SAMPLES=5 \
  node benchmarks/transaction-pipeline-bench.js

# 1,000-input P2PKH transaction
CHAIN_DEPTH=10 SCRIPT_BYTES=1 WIDE_INPUTS=1000 BENCH_SAMPLES=3 \
  node benchmarks/transaction-pipeline-bench.js
```

| Workload (median) | `main` | Optimized | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4.17 MB cold Atomic BEEF serialize | 150.80 ms | 16.11 ms | 89.3% faster |
| 4.17 MB warm Atomic BEEF serialize | 132.47 ms | 1.46 ms | 98.9% faster |
| 4.17 MB copy-safe structural parse | 3.77 ms | 0.95 ms | 74.8% faster |
| 4.17 MB zero-copy structural parse | unavailable | 0.51 ms | 86.4% faster than baseline copy-safe parse |
| 4.17 MB linked Atomic BEEF parse | 13.60 ms | 12.62 ms | 7.2% faster |
| 1,000-link spend-chain verification | 1.82 ms | 0.73 ms | 60.0% faster |
| 4.17 MB parse and topological sort | 12.40 ms | 5.71 ms | 54.0% faster |
| 1,000-input P2PKH sign | 1,266.19 ms | 1,161.64 ms | 8.3% faster |
| 1,000-input P2PKH verify | 2,090.32 ms | 1,213.03 ms | 42.0% faster |

The default 2,000-link, 4.24 MB workload completes cold serialization, zero-copy structural parsing, linked parsing, verification, and sorting in roughly 69 ms of measured median/one-shot work on the optimized build. The same workload overflows the JavaScript stack on `main`; the iterative implementation is also regression-tested at 3,000 links.

### Large-data wallet and serialization paths

The retained large-data benchmark measures an 8 MiB generic payload against an
unmodified build from commit `a9a432fbc` and the optimized build on the same
Apple Silicon host with Node.js v25.9.0:

```bash
WALLET_BENCH_BYTES=8388608 BENCH_SAMPLES=7 \
  node benchmarks/large-data-wallet-bench.js
```

| Workload (median) | Baseline | Optimized | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8 MiB direct `Script.fromHex` | 171.49 ms | 23.52 ms | 86.3% faster |
| 8 MiB warm `Beef.toUint8ArrayAtomic` | 1.701 ms | 0.0067 ms | 99.6% faster |
| 8 MiB Wallet Wire `internalizeAction` round trip | 68.88 ms | 1.41 ms | 98.0% faster |

The subsequent zero-copy Wallet Wire pass was measured separately against its
immediate branch base (`af70681d9`) with nine samples on the same host. It
pre-sizes the request/response writers and hands their written views directly
to the compact-byte transport:

| 8 MiB Wallet Wire workload (median) | Immediate base | Zero-copy handoff | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `internalizeAction` round trip | 1.407 ms | 0.471 ms | 66.5% faster |
| `createAction` BEEF request plus signable BEEF response | 2.905 ms | 0.712 ms | 75.5% faster |

The benchmark accepts `SDK_DIST_ROOT` to run the exact same code against
another built SDK. Atomic BEEF caching is mutation-aware, so graph changes
invalidate the cached bytes before reuse.

Wallet Wire retains its required `number[]` method for compatibility and adds an
optional `Uint8Array` lane. The transceiver selects compact bytes only when the
transport advertises support; the processor and HTTP binary transport implement
both forms. Other wallet substrates keep their existing JSON, structured-clone,
or native-bridge contracts. No BRC-100 arguments, results, or transport
protocols change.

Large binary values therefore follow the cheapest representation supported by
each existing substrate:

| Wallet client substrate | Large-data behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Cicada / HTTP Wallet Wire | Compact `Uint8Array` frames end to end; legacy `number[]` implementations remain compatible. |
| Direct Wallet Wire processor | Compact `Uint8Array` frames with no transport serialization. |
| XDM | Browser structured clone carries `Uint8Array` values without SDK-side JSON conversion or boxing. |
| `window.CWI` | Direct BRC-100 delegation; arguments and results are not reserialized by the SDK. |
| HTTP JSON | Existing JSON wire representation is preserved. |
| React Native WebView | Existing stringified native-bridge representation is preserved. |

XDM does not transfer ownership of caller buffers because doing so would detach
application-owned BRC-100 arguments. The JSON and native-bridge substrates do
not substitute a binary encoding because that would change their protocols.

Wallet Toolbox has a separate reproducible frontier benchmark:

```bash
node ../wallet/wallet-toolbox/benchmarks/ancestor-fetch-bench.mjs
```

With 32 independent ancestors and a fixed 10 ms mock service latency, sequential `main` takes 358.55 ms. The bounded eight-way implementation takes 54.34 ms (84.8% faster, 6.6x throughput) while preserving deterministic merge order. Negotiated base64 JSON-RPC reduces a representative 1 MiB binary payload from 3,743,755 bytes to 1,398,147 bytes, a 62.7% wire-size reduction; legacy peers continue to receive numeric arrays.

### Signature-hash cache lifetime

`Spend` invalidates its internally owned signature-hash cache at the start of every validation, so a standalone instance remains safe to reuse after transaction fields are mutated. A `SignatureHashCache` supplied to `Spend` is externally owned and may be shared across inputs only for a single immutable signing or verification pass. Callers must create a fresh cache after mutating prevouts, sequences, outputs, or any other signed transaction field.

## BigNumber Benchmarks

The benchmark scripts measure extremely large number operations and script number serialization performance.
